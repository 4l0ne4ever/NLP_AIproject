Hopper, "Joyce?"
Powell, "This the wall she was talking about, Chief?"
Hopper, "A trooper found something in the, uh... water that's at the quarry."
Hopper, "Our working theory right now is that Will... crashed his bike, he... made his way over the quarry and, uh... accidentally fell in."
Hopper, "The earth must have given way."
Hopper, "Joyce?"
Hopper, "Do you understand what I'm saying?"
Joyce, "No."
Joyce, "Whoever you found... is not my boy."
Joyce, "It's not Will."
Hopper, "Joyce."
Joyce, "No, you don't understand."
Joyce, "I talked to him... a half hour ago."
Joyce, "He was... He was here."
Joyce, "He was... He was talking with these."
Hopper, "Talking?"
Joyce, "Uh-huh."
Joyce, "One blink for yes, two for no."
Joyce, "And... And, uh..."
Joyce, "And then I made this so he could talk to me."
Joyce, "Cause he was hiding... from that... that thing."
Hopper, "The thing that came out of the wall?"
Hopper, "The thing that chased you?"
Joyce, "Yeah."
Joyce, "Yeah."
Jonathan, "Mom, come on, please."
Jonathan, "You’ve gotta stop this."
Joyce, "No, maybe he’s..."
Joyce, "It’s after him!"
Joyce, "He’s in danger. We have to find him! We..."
Hopper, "What exactly was this thing?"
Hopper, "It was some kind of animal, you said?"
Joyce, "Uh, no, it was..."
Joyce, "It was almost... human, but it wasn’t. It..."
Joyce, "It had these long arms and... it didn’t have a face."
Hopper, "It didn’t have a face?"
Hopper, "Joyce."
Joyce, "It didn’t have a face..."
Hopper, "Joyce, listen to me."
Hopper, "Listen to me."
Hopper, "After Sarah..."
Hopper, "I saw her, too."
Hopper, "And I heard her."
Hopper, "I didn’t know what was real."
Hopper, "And then I figured out that it was in my mind."
Hopper, "And I had to pack all that away."
Hopper, "Otherwise, I was gonna fall down a hole... that I couldn’t get out of."
Joyce, "No, you’re... you’re talking about grief."
Joyce, "This is different."
Hopper, "I’m just saying that you..."
Joyce, "No, I know what you’re saying, Hop."
Joyce, "I swear to you, I know what I saw."
Joyce, "And I’m not crazy."
Hopper, "I’m not saying that you’re crazy."
Joyce, "No... You are."
Joyce, "And I understand, but..."
Joyce, "God, I..."
Joyce, "I need you to believe me."
Joyce, "Please."
Joyce, "Please."
Hopper, "Listen..."
Hopper, "I think you should go to the morgue tomorrow and see him for yourself."
Hopper, "It’ll give you the answers that you need."
Hopper, "But tonight..."
Joyce, "Oh, God."
Hopper, "...I want you to try to get some sleep, if you can."

Mike, "Can you please stop that?"
Mike, "Are you deaf?"
Mike, "I thought we were friends, you know?"
Mike, "But friends tell each other the truth."
Mike, "And they definitely don’t lie to each other."
Mike, "You made me think Will was okay, that he was still out there,"
Mike, "but he wasn’t. He wasn’t!"
Mike, "Maybe you thought you were helping, but you weren’t."
Mike, "You hurt me. Do you understand?"
Mike, "What you did sucks."
Mike, "Lucas was right about you."
Mike, "All along."

Steve, "Yeah, okay, but why didn’t you just talk to me?"
Steve, "That’s crazy."
Nancy, "I don’t know, I... I was scared."

Nancy, "I don’t think it was a mask."
Steve, "But he had no face?"
Nancy, "I don’t know!"
Nancy, "I don’t know, I just..."

Nancy, "Oh, this is bad."
Nancy, "This is really bad."
Steve, "What?"
Nancy, "The cops..."
Nancy, "they’re gonna want to talk to all of us now."
Nancy, "Tommy, Carol, everybody who was at the party."
Steve, "So?"
Nancy, "My parents are gonna murder me!"
Steve, "Are you serious right now?"
Nancy, "You don’t understand. My dad’s a grade-A asshole."
Steve, "Barb is missing! And you’re worried about your dad?"
Nancy, "Okay, just... When you talk to the cops, just..."
Nancy, "don’t mention the beers."
Nancy, "It’s just gonna get us both in trouble,"
Nancy, "and Barbara’s got nothing to do with it, okay?"

Jonathan, "We have to deal with the funeral!"
Joyce, "The funeral?"
Joyce, "For... for who?"
Joyce, "For that thing back there?"
Jonathan, "Okay, let me get this straight."
Jonathan, "Will, that’s not his body, because he’s in the lights, right?"
Jonathan, "And there’s a monster in the wall?"
Jonathan, "Do you even hear yourself?"
Joyce, "I know it sounds crazy."
Joyce, "I sound crazy!"
Jonathan, "Yeah."
Joyce, "You think I don’t know that?"
Joyce, "It is crazy!"
Joyce, "But I heard him, Jonathan."
Joyce, "He talked to me!"
Joyce, "Will is... is calling to me!"
Joyce, "And he’s out there, and he’s alone, and he’s scared, and I..."
Joyce, "I don’t care if anyone believes me!"
Joyce, "I am not gonna stop looking for him until I find him and bring him home."
Joyce, "I am going to bring him home!"
Jonathan, "Yeah, well, while you’re talking to the lights,"

Lucas, "It’s probably the Blackburns’ next door."
Mike, "Uh, did that sound like a baby to you?"
Mike, "That was Will!"
Lucas, "Mike..."
Mike, "Lucas, you don’t understand. He spoke last night."
Mike, "Words!"
Mike, "He was singing that weird song he loves. Even El heard him!"
Lucas, "Oh, well, if the weirdo heard him, then I guess..."
Dustin, "Are you sure you’re on the right channel?"
Mike, "I don’t think it’s about that."
Mike, "I think, somehow, she’s channeling him."
Dustin, "Like... like Professor X."
Mike, "Yeah."
Lucas, "Are you actually believing this crap?"
Dustin, "I don’t know, I mean..."
Dustin, "Do you remember when Will fell off his bike and broke his finger?"
Dustin, "He sounded a lot like that."
Lucas, "Did you guys not see what I saw?"
Lucas, "They pulled Will’s body out of the water."
Lucas, "He’s dead!"
Mike, "Well, maybe it’s his ghost. Maybe he’s haunting us."
Lucas, "It’s not his ghost."
Mike, "So how do you know that?"
Lucas, "I just do!"
Mike, "Then what was in that water?"
Lucas, "I don’t know!"
Lucas, "All I know is Will is alive."
Lucas, "Will is alive!"
Lucas, "He’s out there somewhere."
Lucas, "All we have to do is find him."

Mike, "We need to get El to a stronger radio."
Dustin, "Mr. Clarke’s Heathkit ham shack."
Mike, "Yeah."

Nancy, "It wasn’t really an argument."
Nancy, "Barb just wanted to leave."
Nancy, "I didn’t, so, I..."
Nancy, "I told her to just go home."
Powell, "Then what?"
Nancy, "Then I went upstairs to put on some dry clothes."
Powell, "And the next day, you went back and..."
Powell, "saw a bear, you’re thinking?"
Nancy, "I don’t know what it was, but..."
Nancy, "I think..."
Nancy, "I think maybe it took Barb."
Nancy, "You need to check behind Steve’s house..."
Powell, "We did."
Powell, "There’s nothing there."
Powell, "There’s no sign of a bear."
Callahan, "And no car."
Nancy, "What?"
Callahan, "Look."
Callahan, "We figure that Barbara came back last night"
Callahan, "and then she took off, went somewhere else."
Callahan, "Has she ever talked to you about running off?"
Callahan, "Leaving town, maybe?"
Nancy, "No."
Nancy, "No, Barb wouldn’t do that, ever."
Powell, "She wasn’t maybe upset about the fact that you were spending time with this boy?"
Powell, "Uh, Steve Harrington?"
Nancy, "What? No!"
Powell, "Maybe she was jealous because she saw you go up to Steve’s room?"
Nancy, "It wasn’t like that."
Powell, "Like what?"
Nancy, "Steve and me, we’re... we’re just friends."
Nancy, "We... we just talked."
Powell, "Now was this before or after you changed out of your clothes?"

Gary, "They told you that they were gonna take care of the autopsy, huh?"
Gary, "Yeah. Claimed jurisdiction. Kicked me out."
Gary, "Well, it all seemed a bit over the top to me, considering..."
Hopper, "Considering what?"
Gary, "Considering this was Will Byers and not John F. Kennedy."
Hopper, "Thanks for stopping by, Gary."
Gary, "Sure thing."
Reporter, "...let the people know that, uh, the troopers are on duty"

Mr. Clarke, "And then..."
Mr. Clarke, "the Heathkit is all yours for the rest of the day."
Mr. Clarke, "What do you say?"
Mr. Clarke, "I don’t believe we’ve met. What’s your name?"

Jonathan, "I don’t know."
Jonathan, "It’s weird."
Nancy, "And you’re sure you didn’t see anyone else out there?"

O'Bannon, "So, you on that case or what?"
Hopper, "I just saw him on patrol, you know?"
Hopper, "Dumb luck."
O'Bannon, "So that quarry, that’s, uh..."
O'Bannon, "that’s state-run, where they found the boy, huh?"
Hopper, "Yeah."
Hopper, "Yeah, well, that’s funny."
Hopper, "’Cause, you know, I know for a fact that it’s run by the Sattler Company."
Hopper, "Frank Sattler? Decent guy, still got a couple operational quarries up in Roane."
O'Bannon, "Is that right?"

O'Bannon, "I don’t know!"
O'Bannon, "I don’t know. They..."
O'Bannon, "they just told me to call it in and not let anybody get too close."
Hopper, "Get close to what?"
O'Bannon, "The body."
