Unknown,"We're going down! We're going down!"
Steve,"Yeah, no shit, Harrington! Why don't these buttons work?! What do you think I'm doing?! Oh! My groin. It fell on my groin. I can't move."
Erica,"Press the button! Push it!"
Dustin,"Come on, press something! Just press the button! Is everyone okay? Hey. What if we climbed out? What were you saying about climbing?"
Robin,"Yeah, I'm great, now that I know that Russians can't design elevators! I think we've clearly established that those buttons don't work. Yeah, if we had a keycard. It's an electronic lock. Same as the loading dock door. If we don't have a keycard, it won't operate, meaning..."
Dustin,"We're stuck in here."
Robin,"Yeah."
Erica,"Just so you nerds are aware, I'm supposed to be spending the night at Tina's, and Tina always covers for me. But if I'm not home for Uncle Jack's party tomorrow and my mom finds out you three are responsible, she's gonna hunt you down, one by one, and slit your throat."
Steve,"I don't care about Tina! Or Uncle Jack's party! Your mom's not gonna be able to find us if we're dead in a Russian elevator!"
Unknown,"Looks like somebody's home. Did you hear that?"
Hopper,"Where's that coming from? It's below us. Hey, dipshits! Hawkins PD. Hands in the air. Don't make me say it again! English. You speak English? I can't understand you! No understand! Hopper! Don't move! Drop the gun. Drop it! You understand what I'm saying, big guy? Drop the weapon. So you do understand what I'm saying, huh? And, yeah, you don't put that thing away, I'm gonna blow some daylight into that thick skull of yours. Wanna test that theory? I'm gonna count to three. One, two, three! Go! Move, Joyce! Come on, Smirnoff. You're coming with us! Go, go, go! Let's go! Let's go! Move it, Smirnoff! Move it! Run! Get us outta here! Oh, God! Son of a bitch. Son of a bitch! Okay, a magnet? Magnets? Do you know 'magnet'? Magnet? Okay, so, uh, magnit... on my... my fridge, my icebox, and then they... they fell. They demagnetized, stopped working. Uh, do you understand? Okay, so is that because of the machines that you're working on? Machina, machina, yes. You're givin' me a headache, both of you! Hold on, please. One minute. Yeah, what? Keep it in park, please. You do... do something useful. Damn it. Still think it was our government?"
Alexei,"Magnit. Da. Da, da, machina."
Joyce,"Joyce! Drive! Come on, Joyce! Quit screwin' around! Are you kidding me? I'm trying! Joyce, please, drive! Drive! Hang on! I am making progress. Progress. Thought we knew. But now we know-know, because I've confirmed them. You're welcome. Yeah, duh! I thought this friend of yours lived in Illinois. So we're walking to Illinois? Isn't there someone in Indiana who speaks Russian that... I mean, fine. Just saying."
Hopper,"Machina, machina! Yes, machina... Vroom, vroom. Oh, not... not the car. The machines at Hess Farm where... where we kidnapped you... Yeah? Why don't you confirm whether this baby'll start, huh? Shut up, Smirnoff! I said shut your damn... Whoa! He's not really a friend. He's more like an acquaintance. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, we're gonna walk to Illinois. You know, I figure we'll get there by, like, Friday evening. I hope that works for your schedule. Jesus Christ, Joyce. We're not walking to Illinois, okay? I don't know, okay? I will... I will figure something out. You know what? I'm all ears, Joyce. I'm all ears. I'm all ears!"
Jonathan,"Do you realize what time it is? It's 6:00 a.m. and, uh, I had a late night with Fagin and the gang, so... What? Nancy, please tell me you're joking. Uh... He's not even here. Where is he? Why wouldn't he be safe?"
Nancy,"Listen to me, okay? It's not a joke. And, yes, I know I'm insane and irrational and out of touch, but can you save your lecture, because I really don't give a shit right now. I just... I need you to put me on the phone with your brother. Jonathan... Please. Nancy? Why wouldn't he be safe? I'm at the hospital with Driscoll. She's been sedated for a few hours and the doctors are still running tests."
Max,"Where is he? My... My mom? What are they doing? Does it still hurt? Well, it's a good thing you're not Mike, then. 'Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.' And you'd be in constant pain."
Mike,"Not now, Mom! Illinois? Illinois, like the state? The state of Illinois? Something's not right. I can't get Hopper off my back all summer, now all of a sudden, he's hiking with Will's mom to Illinois? And Dustin's MIA, too? I mean, this can't be a coincidence. The bottom line is, they're not here. It's up to us."
Max,"Woods? They're going to Ill-annoy. Only when I talk. What does it matter? Up to us to do what exactly?"
Mike,"Find Billy and stop him."
Max,"Okay, yeah, that's a really nice sentiment, but even if El could find him again, and that's a pretty big if, then what?"
Mike,"We burn the shit out of him and make sure he doesn't escape this time."
Max,"Okay, then what?"
Mike,"Then we win."
Max,"No, see, that's the problem. We don't. We don't win. We got the Mind Flayer out of Will before and he just came right back. We don't just have to stop Billy, we have to stop the Mind Flayer."
Mike,"How in the hell do we do that?"
Max,"I don't know. Maybe El does."
Mike,"What are they still doing in there?"
Lucas,"I don't know. Girls just like hanging out in bathrooms."
Mike,"Why?"
Lucas,"I mean, I don't know."
Mike,"They're conspiring against me."
Lucas,"That's what you're concerned about now?"
Mike,"It's not my main concern. It's just a sub-concern."
Lucas,"I thought it was already over."
Mike,"It's not over, okay? We're just taking a break."
Lucas,"She said she dumped your ass. That doesn't sound like a break."
Max,"It wasn't! You guys do realize we can still hear everything you're saying, right?"
Mike,"Conspiring. I told you, they're conspiring. Not now, Mom!"
Nancy,"Mike, open the door."
Dustin,"Code red, I repeat, code red. Does anyone copy? This is a code red, I repeat, a code red. This is a code red, I repeat, a code red. Does anyone copy? We are innocent children and we are trapped under Starcourt Mall. The Red Army has infiltrated Hawkins, and if we are found, they will torture and kill us."
Steve,"Hey. Gotta take it easy on that thing. Gonna drain the battery."
Dustin,"The mall just opened. So someone could be in range."
Steve,"What do you think, Petey the Mall Cop is gonna rappel down here and save the day? All right, why are you such a cranky pants after getting to spend the night with Robin?"
Dustin,"Shh! Jesus Christ."
Steve,"Will you just give up on your creepy dream already?"
Dustin,"I heard you guys talking all night."
Steve,"We were trying to figure out a way to open up the door while you children were sleeping. After eight hours, we're still exactly nowhere, which is, you know, probably just a little bit of the reason why I'm feeling just... a tad cranky."
Dustin,"What are you doing?"
Steve,"What does it look like I'm doing? I'm taking a leak. Look away. Look away!"
Robin,"Can you redirect your stream, please?"
Steve,"Hey, hey! Be careful, careful, careful! We don't even know what that is."
Robin,"Exactly. It could be useful."
Steve,"Useful how?"
Robin,"We can survive down here a long time without food, but if the human body doesn't get water, it will die."
Steve,"I hate to break it to you, but this is not water."
Robin,"No, but it's a liquid, and if it comes down to me drinking that shit or dying of thirst, I drink."
Dustin,"We've got company."
Steve,"Let's go. Go. Go, go, go, go, go. Henderson. Go, go."
Erica,"I'm going!"
Robin,"Come on, Steve, let's go!"
Steve,"Jesus Christ."
Erica,"Ooh!"
Robin,"You still wanna drink that?"
Dustin,"Holy mother of God."
Steve,"Well... hope you guys are in good shape. Looking at you, roast beef. Let's go, come on."
Dustin,"Why me?"
Nancy,"It was the same thing, the exact same thing that happened to Will last year. And look at this. Look at the body temperatures."
Will,"He likes it cold."
Mike,"Okay, so this crazy old woman who was eating fertilizer..."
Nancy,"Mrs. Driscoll. Last night. Around 9:00."
Mike,"Right, yeah, Mrs. Driscoll. What time was this attack?"
Jonathan,"You waited all night to call?"
Nancy,"I was waiting for the doctors to run some tests."
Will,"Well, I'm here now, aren't I?"
Nancy,"Hallelujah! Um, so, wha... what time was your... sauna test?"
Mike and Will,"Around 9:00."
Nancy,"Well, that proves it. That proves my theory. She's flayed, just like Billy."
Jonathan,"Flayed?"
Nancy,"The Mind Flayer. He flays people. Takes over their mind. Once they do that, they basically become him."
Will,"If there are two flayed..."
Nancy,"We have to assume there are more."
Eleven,"Heather. Billy was doing something to her. She was scared. She was screaming. Bad screams."
Lucas,"What's a good scream?"
Eleven,"Max said... Doesn't matter."
Jonathan,"I'm sorry, I'm lost. Who is Heather?"
Nancy,"She's a lifeguard at the pool."
Mike,"Heather Holloway?"
Nancy and Jonathan,"Tom."
Mike,"Seriously? Seat belts."
Hopper,"Oh, my God. Can you not walk so close? I get it, I get it. You're upset, right? 'Cause I, uh... I blew up the car? Well, I just want to remind you of something, Joyce. I am not a mechanic."
Joyce,"Can you not walk so close to me? You stink. Yeah, with me in it. Yeah, clearly. That's why you should've listened to Alexei."
Hopper,"Yeah, duh! Oh, right, yeah. Your new boyfriend, right? Oh, here we go."
Joyce,"Yes. Every man I talk to from now on has to be my boyfriend. Yeah, he reminds me a bit of a Russian Scott Clarke. Maybe you should go on a date. I don't know, I'm think..."
Todd,"...this guy comes up to me, I'm just pumping gas over here, and he... Hey, whoa! Don't cross me right now!"
Unknown,"Busy day?"
Todd,"You could say that. Some psycho stole that dude's car."
Unknown,"What else? What else did he say? This psycho?"
Todd,"No offense, but I already went over all this with the cops."
Unknown,"I'm not a cop."
Todd,"Yeah, no shit, Khrushchev."
Grigori,"Oh, shit! Don't look at them. At me. Tell me about this psycho."
Dustin,"I mean, you have to admit, as a feat of engineering alone, this is impressive."
Steve,"What are you talking about? It's a total fire hazard. There's no stairs, there's no exit, there's just an elevator that drops you halfway to hell."
Dustin,"They're Commies. You don't pay people, they cut corners."
Steve,"To be fair to our Russian comrades, I don't think this tunnel was designed for walking."
Dustin,"Think about it, they developed the perfect system for transporting that cargo. It all comes into the mall like any old delivery. And then they load it up onto those trucks and nobody's the wiser."
Steve,"You think they built this whole mall so they could transport that green poison?"
Dustin,"I very seriously doubt it's something as boring as poison. It's gotta be much more valuable, like promethium or something."
Erica,"What the hell is promethium?"
Dustin,"It's what Victor Stone's dad used to make Cyborg's bionic and cybernetic components."
Erica,"You're all so nerdy, it makes me physically ill."
Steve,"No, no, no. No, don't lump me in with them. I'm not a nerd, all right?"
Robin,"Why so sensitive, Harrington? Afraid of losing cool points to a ten-year-old child?"
Steve,"No, I'm just saying I don't know jack shit about Prometheus."
Dustin,"Promethium. Prometheus is a Greek mythological figure, but whatever. All I'm saying is, it's probably being used to make something."
Robin,"Or power something."
Steve,"Like a nuclear weapon?"
Dustin,"Totally."
Steve,"Walking towards a nuclear weapon. That's great. That'd be great."
Robin,"But if they're building something, why here?"
Dustin,"I mean, Hawkins. Seriously. Of all places. At the very best, we're a toilet stop on your way to Disneyland, but maybe that's it. Maybe it's our very..."
Steve,"You think the Russians know?"
Dustin,"They could."
Steve,"So it's connected?"
Dustin,"Maybe."
Steve,"How?"
Dustin,"I don't know, but it's... Possible."
Robin,"I'm sorry, is there something you'd like to share with the class?"
Dustin and Robin,"Walkie."
Unknown,"It's the code."
Robin,"Wherever that broadcast is coming from..."
Dustin,"It's close. And if there's one thing we know about that signal... It can reach the surface."
Robin,"Let's go."
Nancy,"Tom? Heather? Jesus, it's freezing. Do you guys smell that? More chemicals."
Mike,"You think they're guzzling this shit?"
Nancy,"Yeah, either that or they just went on a hell of a cleaning spree."
Will,"But last year, Will didn't eat chemicals. Did you?"
Eleven,"No. This is something new."
Mike,"Mr. Clarke, fifth grade. Posit. What happens when you mix chemicals together?"
Lucas and Will,"You create a new substance."
Nancy,"What if they're making something?"
Max,"In themselves? I mean, come on, if you drink this crap, it'll kill you."
Will,"Yeah, if you're human."
Nancy,"Blood. Yesterday, Tom had a bandage on his forehead. He was attacked. They must have tied them. They must have taken them somewhere. Mrs. Driscoll. She kept saying... 'I have to go back.' What if the flaying, it's taking place somewhere else? There must be a place where all this started, right? A source."
Eleven,"Somewhere he didn't want me to see."
Nancy,"If we can find the source, then maybe we can stop him. Or at least stop it from spreading or doing whatever the hell he's doing with those chemicals."
Mike,"How do we find it?"
Nancy,"Mrs. Driscoll. If she wants to go back so badly, why don't we let her?"
Hopper,"Jim Hopper, Joyce Byers, Smirnoff."
Joyce,"Alexei."
Hopper,"Alexei. I don't know. Open the damn door! Yeah, what? Glass houses, Joyce. You know, pot calling the kettle black."
Murray,"Surname. Family name! It's all right. Don't worry. He's a little bit eccentric, but... he's completely harmless. Name. Hi, Jim. No. No. No, you do not get to question me. You have dragged an enemy of the state into my home as carelessly as a child drags in shit on his shoe. I will search him until I am satisfied."
Alexei,"Get that out of my face, you bald American pig."
Murray,"I may be bald, but you're the one in handcuffs, Soviet scum. Watch it. Silence, scum."
Joyce,"Hopper. Just c'mere. I need to talk to you. What? This is not gonna work. What do you mean? He's not eccentric, he's certifiable. Oh, come on. Excuse me! What? Do me a favor and move your lovers' quarrel elsewhere."
Hopper,"What? Oh, oh, this? Not a lovers' quarrel, pal."
Murray,"Spare me! What is your problem?"
Hopper,"Please, stop talking!"
Joyce,"No! We have had a very long day. We have been shot at, nearly blown up, walked God knows how many miles in a hundred degree heat, stole a car, all while being chased by this gigantic... psychopath, all so we could bring him to you. Because somehow, you're the closest person who speaks Russian, which I can't believe. But that doesn't matter because, unfortunately, we're here. So, if you don't mind, put that thing away, stop behaving like a jackass, and ask him what he's doing that's making my magnets fall off my damn fridge! Please."
Robin,"Okay, clear. Clear, come on, let's go. Okay, that was close. Too close."
Dustin,"Relax. All right? Relax. Nobody saw..."
Steve,"Shit. Jesus! Red Dawn. First floor, northwest."
Robin,"Saw what?"
Steve,"The comms room."
Robin,"You saw the comms room?"
Steve,"Correct. Positive. The door was open for a second, and I saw a bunch of lights and machines and shit in there."
Robin,"That could be a hundred different things."
Steve,"I'll take those odds. All right. We're gonna move fast, we're gonna stay low. Okay?"
Robin,"Okay."
Unknown,"Tread lightly! Who are you?"
Steve,"Silver cat... Silver cat. China?"
Unknown,"I don't understand."
Steve,"You did it! You won a fight! Jeez... Getting us our ticket out of here."
Dustin,"Dude! Have a picnic? We came here for the radio. This plan is way better. If I knew Steve could knock out a Russian, that would've been our plan in the first place."
Robin,"You want to walk all the way back?"
Steve,"Well, we can hang out for a little bit, relax, have a picnic maybe."
Dustin,"There's something up there."
Steve,"Let's go."
Robin,"Holy shit."
Nancy,"I was just going to visit my grandma again. And... And this... this is my family."
Unknown,"Extended."
Nancy,"Yeah, but..."
Unknown,"I don't care who they are. You know the rules. Two visitors at a time. Two! Girl, this child has lost her mind. She brought a whole zoo in here."
Jonathan,"You know, those things that I said yesterday, I... I didn't mean them. I don't think you're like those assholes. At all. I never have. I... I was just... Angry?"
Nancy,"I know. Which I still don't get. I mean, I was just completely, utterly, mortifyingly... wrong."
Jonathan,"Don't let that go to your head."
Nancy,"I won't. I just look forward to you never doubting me again."
Unknown,"Oh, come on, you piece of shit!"
Lucas,"Dude, I think that was it."
Mike,"That was what?"
Lucas,"The olive branch."
Mike,"The what?"
Lucas,"Oh, my God. You're hopeless. Okay, I'll distract Max, get you an opening. And then talk to her. All right?"
Nancy,"Where is she?"
Jonathan,"I don't know."
Nancy,"Are you sure this is the right room?"
Jonathan,"Yeah."
Tom,"She's gone home."
Nancy,"We were hoping you might come back. Whose blood is that? Tom, whatever you've done, it's not you. He's making you do this."
Jonathan,"Go! This way, this way! Run! Nancy! Hello? Hello?! Here. It's ringing."
Unknown,"I don't care how good her pie is. No, I don't want her in my damn house."
Nancy,"Come on, pick up! Nancy?"
Bruce,"Hi there. I'm here for you, Nancy Drew. Marco... Marco..."
Nancy,"Polo! Go... to... hell!"
Jonathan,"Nancy! Run!"
Nancy,"Help! Help! Is anyone here?! Nancy."
Bruce,"Nancy! Where are you going? Yoo-hoo. Nancy Drew, where are you?"
Jonathan,"No!"
Max,"Got it, two in a row. Best three in a row now."
Lucas,"That was good, that was good."
Max,"Hi. Does your species like M&M's?"
Mike,"I like the new look, by the way. It's cool."
Max,"Thanks."
