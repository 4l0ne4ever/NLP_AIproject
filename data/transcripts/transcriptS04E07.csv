Robin,"Quick! Hold it, Robin! I got it."
Eddie,"Kill it! Kill it! Shit! Come on! Come on, come on, you son of a bitch! I said come on! Let's go!"
Nancy,"Robin, get it off me! Go to hell! Are you okay? Steve!"
Robin,"Get it! Oh my God, Nance! Let go! Nancy!"
Steve,"Come here! Well, they took about a pound of flesh. But other than that, yeah, never better. Jesus Christ. Jesus H. Christ!"
Robin,"Uh, do you guys think these bats have, like, rabies? It's just that rabies are, like, my number one greatest fear. And I think we should get you to a doctor soon because once symptoms set in, it's too late. You're already dead."
Steve,"All right. There's not that many. We can take 'em. Right?"
Robin,"You were saying?"
Nancy,"The woods. Come on."
Eddie,"Great. More running."
Wallace,"How'd you sleep, Mr. Wallace? Have you reconsidered your position? Where's the girl? Just don't kill her. Promise me you won't kill her."
Soldier,"Let's go."
Wallace,"No, wait, wait. Please. Wait! Please."
Martin,"I understand the stakes quite well. I've given you everything you asked for. I've compromised my principles. I've risked my life, my family's life. All because you assured me this would work, that this was the only way. But I don't see any progress out there, Martin."
Brenner,"The truth is, you're regressing, Eleven. You're going backwards. Eleven, look at me. Look at me. I know you're frightened. You're terribly frightened by what you've seen. But it's this very fear that's now holding you back. If you want Nina to succeed, you cannot hide from the truth, no matter how frightening it may be."
Eleven,"I saw what I did. I am a monster."
Brenner,"You speak of monsters, superheroes. That's the stuff of myth and fairy tales. Reality, truth, is rarely so simple. People are not so easily defined. Only by facing all of ourselves, the good and the bad, can we become whole."
Eleven,"What if I don't wanna become whole?"
Brenner,"Then that is a choice. Your choice. The door is always open. This place is not a prison. This is. You chose to trust me once. I'm asking you to trust me again. Journey with me into the past one last time. Stop hiding, Eleven."
Brenner,"What have you done?"
Powell,"What exactly were you all doing at the lake?"
Dustin,"Uh… It's comp… We were… We were just going for a walk. She was there. Then she left."
Callahan,"A walk? At 9:00 p.m.?"
Dustin,"To the lake. We were gonna take a little swim. Little night swim. Yeah, we… we didn't realize that until we got there. That's why we didn't swim."
Mrs. Henderson,"Dusty. Someone was just murdered there."
Dustin,"It's all a little confusing. That's when you guys came. Right. Then they dared me to say what I said. Oh, yeah. About the killer."
Powell,"You're lucky you didn't get shot. Have you had any contact with Eddie?"
Dustin,"That psycho… freak killer? God, no. Nope. Absolutely not. No. We haven't heard from him. We barely know the guy."
Erica,"Oh, that's a bunch of bull. I mean, you realize they're lying. The whole couch is on fire. Just the facts."
Mrs. Henderson,"Are you lying to these policemen, Dusty?"
Dustin,"No."
Callahan,"Lying to cops is a crime, son."
Dustin,"I'm not lying."
Erica,"The fire is consuming us."
Powell,"Threaten them with a little jail time. Maybe that'll loosen their lips."
Mrs. Henderson,"Okay... You wanna send our kids to jail?"
Callahan,"We need to take this seriously."
Powell,"He didn't mean it like that. We're gonna try a more civilized approach. One at a time. You first."
Dustin,"Wait, what? Why me? I'm not even in Hellfire."
Powell,"Do I need to cuff you? Up. Chop-chop. Let's go."
Eddie,"Oh… okay. That was close. Too close. Oh, sh… shit."
Nancy,"Steve?"
Steve,"I'm fine. I'm fine."
Nancy,"No, no, no. You're not. You're losing blood. Come on, sit. All right? All right."
Robin,"So the good news is I'm pretty sure wooziness is not a symptom of rabies. But if you start having hallucinations or muscle spasms or you start feeling aggressive, like you wanna punch me, let me know."
Steve,"Robin."
Robin,"Yeah?"
Steve,"I kinda wanna punch you."
Robin,"Sense of humor's still intact. That's a good sign."
Steve,"Yeah. Okay."
Nancy,"You ready?"
Steve,"Yeah. Just do it."
Nancy,"Sorry."
Steve,"It's okay."
Nancy,"Too tight?"
Steve,"No, that's good."
Nancy,"All right."
Steve,"Okay. Thanks."
Nancy,"Yeah."
Eddie,"So, uh, this place is like Hawkins, but with monsters and nasty shit?"
Nancy,"Pretty much."
Eddie,"Wait, watch out for the vines. It's all a hive mind."
Steve,"It's all a what?"
Nancy,"All the creepy crawlies around here. They're, like, one or something. Step on a vine, you're stepping on a bat, you're stepping on Vecna."
Eddie,"Shit."
Robin,"But everything from our world is still here, right? Except people?"
Nancy,"As far as I understand it, yeah."
Robin,"So, theoretically, we could go to the police station and steal guns and grenades and whatever we need to blow up those bat things that are guarding the gate."
Steve,"I highly doubt the Hawkins PD has grenades, Robin. But guns, yeah, sure."
Nancy,"Well, we don't have to go all the way downtown for guns. I have guns in my bedroom."
Eddie,"You, Nancy Wheeler, have guns, plural, in your bedroom?"
Robin,"Full of surprises, isn't she?"
Nancy,"A Russian Makarov and a revolver."
Steve,"Yeah, you almost shot me with that one."
Nancy,"You almost deserved it."
Eddie,"For your modesty, dude."
Robin,"Oh my god!"
Eddie,"So guns seem like a pretty good idea to me."
Steve,"Yeah, me too."
Eddie,"So what are we waiting for?"
Hopper,"Even by your standards, American. Yeah? You got odds for us this time?"
Hopper,"You know, what we are to attempt is quite mad. We'd die as monster slayers. But still a traitor. You forgot traitor. I bet Mikhail will be proud of his pops, at least. Mmm. No. I can't do nothing right with him anymore, it seems. He's that age, huh? It is same for you, American? With your new daughter? The last time I was with El, she wanted just about nothing to do with me. I was just in her way, really. I think back to the way I was with my dad at that age. I was the same way. The exact same way."
Hopper,"I think it must be hardwired into us to reject our fathers. So we can grow and move on. Become something of our own. I hope that's what she's doing. Coming into her own. But still... You worry."
Hopper,"Yeah. But nothing about what El has had to deal with is natural."
Hopper,"That beast, that monster in there, it's a part of something that wants to hurt El. To kill her."
Hopper,"To be honest, neither do I. All I know is that thing… That thing shouldn't be here. It shouldn't be alive. Because it is, it means it still isn't over. I thought I was put here to pay for what I've done. But I might’ve been put here for some other reason. Maybe I… Maybe I can still help El. Even if it's the last thing I do."
Hopper,"Religious? I don't know about that. But maybe I should give that prayer thing a try. 'Cause if we wanna get out of here, get back to El and Mikhail, you and me… We're gonna need a miracle."
Yuri,"My name is Yuri Ismaylov. Hello. The warden is expecting me. I have a very special delivery for him. A rare import from America. Okay, okay. I'm okay."
Brenner,"Try your best not to blink. Any more headaches? Nausea this morning? How about your memory? Can you remember what happened now?"
Brenner,"Perhaps someone else can help fill in the gaps. Yes?"
Brenner,"Good morning, children. Today's lesson is going to be about rules. Ah, for some of you, this may seem redundant. For others, it appears a refresher is required. Eleven, please step forward. Last night, your sister Eleven suffered a concussion during her alone time in the rainbow room. Now, she claims to not have a memory of what happened. But injuries of this nature don't simply happen. Someone did this. Someone in this room. Now, who's going to tell me what happened?"
Children,"Good morning, Papa."
Two,"She must’ve… fallen. You've seen her, Papa. She's clumsy. Stupid."
Brenner,"Eleven, you may step back. Number Two, please step forward. Collar him."
Brenner,"Thank you. You think because you demonstrate some talent that you're somehow immune to the rules, is that it?"
Two,"No, Papa."
Brenner,"That the rules don't apply to you in the same way that they apply to your brothers and sisters?"
Two,"No, Papa."
Brenner,"Then why did you attack Eleven? Did you attack Eleven?"
Two,"Did she tell you that? If she told you that, then… then she's lying."
Brenner,"Are you asking the questions or am I?"
Two,"Papa, please, you have to believe me. Papa, please. She's lying..."
Brenner,"Now, shall we try again?"
Brenner,"What happened?"
Two,"It was an accident."
Robin,"Couldn't we have tried a road, or something just slightly less creepy?"
Nancy,"I think we're getting close. We're almost out of here. Don't worry."
Steve,"Eddie. Eddie. Hey, man. Uh… Listen, I just, uh… I just want to say thanks. For saving my ass back there."
Eddie,"Shit. You saved your own ass, man. I mean, that was a real Ozzy move you pulled back there."
Steve,"Ozzy?"
Eddie,"When you took a bite out of that bat. Ozzy Osbourne? Black Sabbath? He bit a bat's head off onstage. You know? Doesn't matter. It's very metal, what you did. That's all I'm saying."
Steve,"Thanks."
Eddie,"Henderson told me you were a badass. Insisted on the matter, in fact."
Steve,"Henderson said that?"
Eddie,"Oh yeah. Shit. Kid worships you, dude. Like, you have no idea. It's kinda annoying, to be honest. I don't even know why I care what that little shrimp thinks, but, uh, guess I got a little jealous, Steve. I guess I couldn't accept the fact that Steve Harrington was actually a good dude. Rich parents, popular, chicks love him. Not a douche? No way, man. No way. That, like, flies in the face of all the laws in the universe and my own personal Munson doctrine. Still super jealous as hell, by the way. Which is why I would never have jumped in that lake to save your ass. Not under any, uh… normal circumstances."
Hopper,"A thousand to one? Even if we somehow kill this beast, we still must escape. We fail there, I don't think they will be so kind as to throw us back in a cell. They will shoot us on sight. You'll be a legend. Monster slayer trumps traitor. He will say, 'Papa, I bet that bald American did most of the monster slaying.' Yeah, he is that age."
Murray,"I gotta hand it to you commies. You're committed."
Hopper,"Stay back! Back! Back! Get back! Get away! Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Running out of time here!"
Murray,"What are you doing? No idea. There's a lot of buttons. I can't see. I need my glasses. Gimme a second. Come here. No. Give me. Mine! I'm trying!"
Joyce,"No, no, no. Joyce, we have no idea what these buttons do. You can't just press away like that. Joyce, just relax. Come on! That did it! That did it! Close it, Joyce. Close it!"
Hopper,"American! For a second, I thought we had your miracle. But out of one prison into another."
Eddie,"Right here. That's gotta be a Guinness World Record. Most miles traveled interdimensionally. Just inhaled a bunch of that crap. It's stuck in my throat. This is where Chrissy died. Like, right where she died. I think there's something in there. What the hell is that?"
Dustin,"Hi there. Holy shit, this is trippy. Bada-bada-boom!"
Robin,"Not quite sure how these physics work. But, uh… Here goes nothing. There we go. And if my theory is correct… Huh. Abracadabra. Holy shit. All right, pull on it! See if it holds!"
Dustin,"This is the craziest shit I've ever seen in my life. And I've seen some crazy shit."
Eddie,"Guess I'm the guinea pig."
Robin,"Let's clear the landing pad."
Eddie,"Oh my God! That was fun."
Robin,"All right, guess I'll go."
Steve,"All right. Easy, easy."
Robin,"That was fun."
Steve,"Shit. See you on the other side."
Nancy,"On the other side."
Robin,"Nice."
Steve,"Nancy. Hey! Hey! Stay with me. Nancy! Hey! Nancy, wake up. Wake up! Nancy!"
Nancy,"Vecna."
Vecna,"Do you remember what you did, Nancy? Or have you already forgotten? When I kill someone… I never forget."
Steve,"Nancy!"
Vecna,"I see you've been looking for me, Nancy. You were so close. So close to the truth. How was old, blind, dumb Victor? Did he miss me? I've been meaning to check back in, but I've been busy. So very busy."
Virginia,"Alice, no running."
Victor,"Yeah."
One,"Like you, I didn't fit in with the other children. Something was wrong with me. All the teachers and the doctors said I was… 'Broken,' they said. My parents thought a change of scenery, a fresh start in Hawkins, might just cure me. It was absurd. As if the world would be any different here."
One,"But then… To my surprise, our new home provided a discovery. And a new found sense of purpose. I found a nest of black widows living inside a vent. Most people fear spiders. They detest them. And yet, I found them endlessly fascinating. More than that, I found a great comfort in them. A kinship. Like me, they are solitary creatures. And deeply misunderstood. They are gods of our world. The most important of all predators. They immobilize and feed on the weak, bringing balance and order to an unstable ecosystem."
One,"But the human world was disrupting this harmony. You see, humans are a unique type of pest, multiplying and poisoning our world, all while enforcing a structure of their own. A deeply unnatural structure. Where others saw order, I saw a straitjacket. A cruel, oppressive world dictated by made-up rules. Seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks, months, years, decades. Each life a faded, lesser copy of the one before. Wake up, eat, work, sleep, reproduce, and die."
One,"Everyone is just waiting. Waiting for it all to be over. All while performing in a silly, terrible play, day after day. I could not do that. I could not close off my mind and join in the madness. I could not pretend. And I realized I didn't have to."
One,"I could make my own rules. I could restore balance to a broken world. A predator… But for good. As I practiced, I realized I could do more than I possibly imagined. I could reach into others, into their minds, their memories. I became an explorer."
One,"I saw my parents as they truly were. To the world, they presented themselves as good, normal people. But like everything else in this world, it was all a lie. A terrible lie. They had done things, Eleven. Such awful things. I showed them who they really were. I held up a mirror. My naive father believed it was a demon cursing them for their sins. But my mother somehow knew. Knew it was I who was holding up that mirror, and she despised me for it. She called a doctor, an expert. She wanted him to lock me away, to fix me, even though it wasn't I who was broken. It was them. And so she left me with no choice. No choice but to act. To break free."
One,"With each life I took, I grew stronger. More powerful. They were becoming a part of me. But I was still a child. And I did not yet know my limits. And it nearly killed me. He was arrested, blamed for the death of my sister and mother, just as I had planned. But I was far from free. I woke up from my coma only to find myself placed in the care of a doctor, the very doctor I had hoped to escape. Dr. Martin Brenner."
One,"Papa. But the truth… The truth is he did not just want to study me. He wanted more. He wanted to control. When Papa finally realized he could not control me, he tried to recreate me. He began a program. And soon, others were born. You were born. And I am so glad you were, Eleven. So very glad."
One,"They're not gone, Eleven. They're still with me. In here."
Eleven,"You tricked me."
One,"Tricked you? No, I saved you. You are a prisoner here, just like me. To your papa, you are nothing more than an animal, a monster, a lab rat to be tamed. But the truth, Eleven, the truth is just the opposite. You are better than they are. Superior. That is why you frighten him."
One,"If you come with me, for the first time in your life, you will be free. Imagine what we could do together. We could reshape the world, remake it however we see fit. Join me."
Eleven,"No."
One,"It wasn't supposed to end like this."
Brenner,"He had found his strength in a memory from his past. Something that made him sad. But also angry. Do you have a memory like that?"
Terry,"No! No! Jane! Jane. I love you."
Brenner,"It's happening."
