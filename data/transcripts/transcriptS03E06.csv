Unknown,"The gate."
Unknown,"I don't understand. You've seen this before?"
Unknown,"Not exactly. Then what, exactly?"
Unknown,"All you need to know is it's bad."
Steve,"It's really bad. Like, end-of-the-human-race-as-we-know-it kind of bad."
Unknown,"And you know about this how?"
Unknown,"Um, Steve? Where's your Russian friend?"
Unknown,"Shit."
Unknown,"Halt! Halt!"
Unknown,"Shit."
Dustin,"Shit. Holy shit! Holy shit! Holy shit! Holy shit! Holy shit! Shit! Holy shit! Holy shit! Holy shit!"
Unknown,"Guards! Go! This way!"
Steve,"Go, go, go, go, go! Move! Let's move! Go! Shit! Shit, shit, shit! Go, go, go! Oh, shit! Oh, shit! Help me, come on! What are you doing?! What the hell?! Look at my outfit! Look at my outfit! You think I just wear this?! Think I'm a spy in a sailor's uniform? How did you get in? I already told you. I told you before. My delivery didn't come, and my friends and I, we thought that it was left at the loading dock, so we went in the room, and then it turned into an elevator, and then... and then we dropped and then, next thing we know, I open my eyes, and we're in this... wonderful facility. But I swear to God, nobody knows about us, nobody saw us. You could just let us go, all right? And I'm not gonna tell anybody about this, okay? Shit happens, life goes on. And, uh... ice... ice cream. Ice cream, okay? You guys know what ice cream is. Everybody loves ice cream. I don't know if you have Russian ice cream or if that's considered gelato. I don't know what's what, but whatever you guys want, seriously. USS Butterscotch, I mean, you gotta try it. It is out of this world, I'm telling ya! I like this guy! 'USS... Butterscotch.' Scoops. Scoops Ahoy. Totally by accident. Hey! Henderson! That's crazy, I was just talking about you."
Erica,"Whoa! Here! Come on, let's go!"
Robin,"Come on! This way! Come on, quick! Hold the door! What'd he say? He says, 'It's strawberry.' I'm sorry? His... Slurpee. He says it's strawberry. Don't touch me! Steve... Steve, wake up. Steve? What did you do to him? What did you do? What did you do?! Don't touch him. Steve? Steve, can you hear me? You are going to regret that, little bitch. Bastards. Let us outta here! Bastards! Let us out! Let us out! I'm so sorry. It's just... I can't believe... I'm gonna die in a secret Russian base with Steve 'The Hair' Harrington. It's just too trippy, man. Do you remember, um, Mrs. Click's sophomore history class? What? Mrs. Clickity-Clackity. That's what us band dweebs called her. It was first period, Tuesdays and Thursdays, so you were always late. And you always had the same breakfast. Bacon, egg, and cheese on a sesame bagel. I sat behind you two days a week for a year. Mister Funny. Mister Cool. The King of Hawkins High himself. Do you even remember me from that class? Of course you don't. You were a real asshole, you know that? If it makes you feel any better, having those things isn't all that great. Seriously. It just baffles me. Everything that people tell you is important, everything that people say you should care about, it's all just... bullshit. But I guess you gotta mess up to figure things out, right? You know, I wish I'd known you in Click's class. Yeah? Really, I do. Maybe you could've helped me pass the class. Maybe instead of being here, I'd be on my way to college right now. And I would have no idea that there were evil Russians beneath our feet, and I would be happily slinging ice cream with some other schmuck. Gotta say, though, I liked being your schmuck. It was fun while it lasted. Where were you two going? Would now be a good time to tell you that I don't like doctors? Where you going with that, doc? There was a code! We heard a code!"
Unknown,"He's here."
Will,"He likes it cold."
Eleven,"He's here. Papa! No. Rainbow. Three to the right, four to the left. Sunflower. Rainbow. Billy knows it. Billy's been there. To the source. Yeah, but... It's a trap. I know. We can't go to Billy, but I think there's another way. A way for me to see where he's been. Billy. Can you hear me? I want to see. I want to see what happened. Something's wrong. Stop! No! No! No! No! I'm... on a beach. A woman. She's... pretty. I... I think she's looking at me. There's... a boy. Billy? It's Billy. It's California. It's a memory. I think I see it. The source. I think I found it. The source. Brimborn... Steelworks. Mike? Mike? Mike? Mike! Mike! He can't hear you. You shouldn't have looked for me. Because now I see you. Now we can all see you. You... let us in. And now... you are going to have to let us stay. Don't you see? All this time, we've been building it. We've been building it... for you. All that work, all that pain... all of it... for you. And now it's time. Time to end it. And we are going to end you. And when you are gone, we are going to end your friends. And then we are going to end... everyone. Get away! No! El, you're okay. It's... It's okay."
Nancy,"Shit. Nancy! Damn! And that's not normal, right? Yeah, and unnecessary. Killing the flayed won't stop the Mind Flayer. We have to find out where it's spreading from. We have to find the source."
Jonathan,"Run! Come on! Jonathan... No! Nancy! Jonathan! Stairs. Goddamn it! Found it. 6522 Cherry Oak Drive. That's close."
Unknown,"Hey! Hey, hey, hey! Two at a time!"
Unknown,"Jesus! What the f..."
Mike,"It can't be good for her to be in there for this long. What if she gets brain damage or something? Oh, and you do? It's too risky. El, I know you think you have to do this, but you don't. It's just, you've only done this before once. And your mom, she loved you, and wanted you to know what happened. And Billy's mind is... is sick, diseased. The Mind Flayer is in him. We don't know that. Mike. I need you to trust me. Just... be careful. El, are you okay? Are you okay? What's going on? Okay, I may be dense, but the last I checked, there weren't any beaches in Hawkins. El, are you okay? Are you okay? What's going on? El, El, we found it. Get out of there. Get out."
Lucas,"Okay, I may be dense, but the last I checked, there weren't any beaches in Hawkins."
Unknown,"Hey! Excuse me. Excuse me. What... what are you doing? What's... what's this doing here? What? Your stand. It's right in the main thoroughfare. Where do you want it, sir? Over there with the rest of the goddamn food stalls. It isn't rocket science. Sheesh, do I have to do everything myself?"
Larry,"My friends in state PD, highway patrol, they're all on the lookout. I got eyes everywhere. The second he pops up... I get a call. A call? Yes. A call. I mean, what more do you people want me to do? Let me explain something to you. This man is a moron, okay? He's driving around in a yellow convertible, for Christ's sakes. He sticks out like a sore thumb. I will find him. And, when I do, may I suggest you bring some backup with you this time? Backup. Some comrades. Since last time, he got the better of you. Please... I... I didn't mean that. You... You don't need backup. This man is your fault, your problem. You're lucky you still breathe. Please. I'm sorry. I... I have a bad temper. I'm going to therapy. You have one day to find this man for me."
Unknown,"A call? Backup. Very lucky. Nod if you understand."
Hopper,"Two Whoppers, extra ketchup, large fry, pack of Marlboro Reds, and one extra-large... Slurpee. Burger King is nowhere near the 7-Eleven, by the way. Let's try this again. Joyce. Alexei, the generators, what are they powering? And tell him that we know it is not the Starcourt Mall, so he can stop selling us that crap. Well, they didn't have cherry. They didn't have it. And it doesn't matter, because it all tastes the same, okay? It is sugar on ice. You tell him that. Tell him what? You tell him that it all tastes the goddamn same! Oh, yeah? You tell him... he can forget it. Jim, that man is an enemy of the state. Yeah, who's been jerking us around for a full day! I get him his cherry Slurpee, then what? He wants a helicopter to charter him to his own private island. I have dealt with assholes like this my entire life. Yesterday in the woods, he could've escaped, but he didn't. He stuck with us. Why do you think that is? It's because... he's scared. He's scared. Not of us, of them. He's scared of that seven-foot-tall Russian freak who could've killed him just as easily as us. Smirnoff knows that if he runs back to his comrades without a scratch on him, they're gonna think that he spilled his guts. So, whether he likes it or not, we... are the best chance he's got. Ooh! I give him 30 seconds before he comes knocking on that door, right back into our arms, with a new sense of humility. Jim... I, uh, believe he has started the car. Hopper. You know, testing us. He's just calling my bluff. I believe he is now driving away. Now, we, uh... we wait. You compromised me, Jim. You do realize that, don't you? I'm gonna have to relocate. Two minutes, Jim. It's a secure line, but any longer than that and they could trace you. Yeah, I want 'em to trace me. This is Jim Hopper... uh... police chief, Hawkins. I got this number from Dr. Sam Owens. Identification code? Oh, no, no, I got it, I got it. 'Antique Chariot.' Listen. Um, tell Owens that the Russkies are opening the gate. Now, he'll know what that means. Not about the Russkies, but about the gate. Tell him that there's an entrance at Starcourt Mall. I know how to get in, but I need backup, a lot of backup. Have him call me back here at 618-625-8313."
Murray,"He says, 'This tastes like shit strawberry.' He says, 'It's strawberry.' He says it's strawberry. So what? Tell him that it all tastes the goddamn same! It's all the same. Sugar on ice. No difference. He respectfully disagrees. It's not the same at all, and he would like... cherry. He says forget it. No cherry. He says, 'No cherry... no deal.' Yeah. Oh, shit! Two minutes, Jim. It's a secure line, but any longer than that and they could trace you. He says he likes strawberry, too."
Alexei,"This tastes like shit strawberry. Tell that stupid man it is not the same in the slightest, and I would like the cherry I requested. No cherry, no deal. What's going on?"
Joyce,"What'd he say? Hop, he did ask for cherry. I mean... I'm not gonna hurt him! What are you doing? Come on! Come on! Jim, that man is an enemy of the state. Joyce, Joyce... Move, move, move! Yes, hello. Uh, this is, uh, Antique Chariot's partner... Wheelbarrow. I don't think Antique Chariot properly conveyed the urgency of our situation. Can't just sit around and wait for a call. Ma'am, I'm gonna need you to stay calm. No. Don't you dare patronize me! I don't know who you are, if you're some glorified secretary or what, but if you don't wanna lose your job, here's what's gonna happen. When I hang up, you're gonna get up off your ass, and you're gonna go find Owens and tell him what's going on. We don't have time to talk about it and neither does he. He's gotta get to Hawkins, and he's gotta bring his men right now! Do you understand me? Thank you. And good day. It's been exactly one minute, Joyce. That's one minute too long. Come on. We gotta go. Vroom, vroom. Back to Hawkins. Come on."
Unknown,"Philadelphia Public Library. What is your identification code? You don't know it? You must be joking. You wrote it down and kept it in your wallet? Your message will be relayed. Philadelphia Public Library."
Unknown,"That one stung. Who do you work for? Scoops Ahoy. How did you get in? I like this guy! 'USS... Butterscotch.' Who do you work for? Oh, come on. No, no! No, seriously... Get your hands off me! Hey... Steve? Steve? Steve? Put them in the chairs. I think your friend need a doctor. Good thing... we have the very best. Bastards."
Unknown,"Who do you work for? How did you find us? More lies. Code. What code? Who knows we are here, little bitch? Is that so?"
Unknown,"Try telling the truth this time, yes? It will make your visit with Dr. Zharkov less painful. What is that shiny little toy? It will help you talk."
Unknown,"Oh, my God! Get ready to run."
Dustin,"So, when we set fire to the hub, we drew the Demodogs away so El could close the gate. But now, for some insane reason, the Russians appear to be trying to reopen it, which just destroys everything we risked our lives for. Yes, of course. Yeah. Yes! I don't believe you. Wait, so you believe everything about El and the gate and the Demodogs and the Mind Flayer, but you question your brother's involvement? Makes total sense. Um, you need help with that? Well, I mean, it's taking a while, so... All right, so if we don't find a more efficient method to stop these fans, we're never gonna find help, and your ice cream buddies are screwed. I'm just being realistic. I mean, we've made it about point-three miles in nine hours. Then we had to walk three hours down that tunnel, so I'd estimate ten miles back to the elevator, which should take us approximately twelve-and-a-half days. Did you just do all of that in your head? I'm good with numbers. Come again? Okay, you better take that back, nerd. But it's not the truth. Fact one: you're a math whiz, apparently. That was a pretty straightforward equation. Fact number two: you're a political junkie. Just because I don't agree with Communism as an ideology... Fact number three: you love My Little Pony. And what does My Little Pony have to do with this? Ah, let's recall the ponies' latest adventure, shall we? The evil centaur team and Tirek turns Applejack into a dragon at Midnight Castle, and then Megan and the other ponies have to use Moochick's magic to defeat his rainbow of darkness, saving them from a lifetime of enslavement. All the pink in the world can't disguise the irrefutable fact that centaurs and castles and dragons and magic are all standard nerd tropes. Ergo, My Little Pony is nerdy. Ergo, you, Erica, are a nerd. Because I'm... a nerd. Let's go... nerd."
Erica,"No. Yeah, no shit, Sherlock. Can't put the truth back in the box. Let's examine the facts, shall we? And how do you know so much about My Little Pony? You..."
Unknown,"Honestly, I don't really feel anything. Do you? Wanna know a secret? What? I like it, too! Morons. They messed up the drug. Oh, no. There's definitely something wrong with us."
Steve,"I mean, I... I feel fine. I kinda feel good. I feel good. They messed it up! Morons. Hey, morons! Moron! Mor... Yeah, Dustin Henderson, he knows. Dustin Henderson. It is your small, curly-haired friend? Oh, curly-haired. Great hair. Small. Kind of like a 'fro. Yeah."
Robin,"I feel normal. Yeah, I feel... I feel fine. Something's wrong."
Unknown,"He's long gone, you big asshole. And he's probably calling Hopper, and Hopper's calling the US cavalry. They're gonna come in here, commando-style, guns a-blazin', and kick your sorry asses back to Russia. You're gonna be two pieces of toast."
Max,"Billy staying in his room on the Fourth of July? No, that's not normal. Yeah, that's what I'm afraid of. If we go to Billy, then the rest of the flayed know where we are. You mean El will kick their butts."
Unknown,"He wants us to find him. It's a trap, I agree. We'll be ambushed. We won't be surprised. We'll know that they're coming, and we will kick their flayed butts."
Unknown,"Hey! Billy, stop! What the hell is wrong with you? What did we talk about, huh? You gotta slide! Afraid you're gonna get hurt, is that it? Well, what then? What? What did I raise, a pussy for a son? That's right, run! Like you always do! Where were you last night? Where were you? Stop lying to me! You saw him again, didn't you? Didn't you?! You... You whore! Bitch! You bastard!"
Woman,"I told you, I was with Wendy. I'm not lying to you! Get away from me! I said, get away! Stop it! No! Don't hurt her!"
Young Billy,"Leave me alone! Mom! I don't understand. Why not? Please, Mom, don't do this. Please come home. No. How long? How long?! I miss you."
Teen Billy,"Get back here! Get up! What, are you scared to fight me? You scared? Get up and fight me, pussy! Pussy!"
Man,"Wait. No. Billy, come over here, I want you to meet someone. This is your new sister. Her name's Maxine. I said, shake her hand."
Billy,"I know. Who's there? I said, who's there?! Who's there?!"
Unknown,"Max. Shake her hand."
Woman,"Woo! Yeah! You did it! I don't know what it was, but it almost gave me a heart attack. Ten more minutes? Okay."
Boy,"Did you see that? Yeah, I saw that! That was at least seven feet. Yeah, okay, ten more minutes. Okay! Okay! Watch out for rip currents!"
Unknown,"What else do you see? You're gonna miss it! David, where you going? David? Adam! Adam!"
