Unknown Speaker 1,"Still nothing?"
Unknown Speaker 2,"Nothing."
Unknown Speaker 3,"Food court? You sure they said food court?"
Unknown Speaker 4,"I'm sorry, have my translation skills been letting you down?"
Unknown Speaker 5,"We don't know it's your kids."
Unknown Speaker 6,"Yes, we do."
Mike,"There's something in there."
Eleven,"No!"
Unknown Speaker 7,"Jesus Christ."
Unknown Speaker 8,"Keep her talking. Keep her awake, okay?"
Dustin,"Jesus Christ."
Mike,"Hey, hey, hey. Stay awake, stay awake. Let's get her on this side, on this side."
Unknown Speaker 9,"Easy, easy, easy, easy."
Robin,"It's, uh... You know, it's not actually that bad. There was a... The goalie on my soccer team, Beth Wildfire, this other girl slid into her leg, and the bone came out of her knee, six inches or something, it was insane."
Unknown Speaker 10,"Robin."
Robin,"Yeah?"
Unknown Speaker 11,"You're not helping."
Robin,"I'm sorry."
Mike,"Okay. All right, El? This is gonna hurt like hell, okay?"
Eleven,"Okay."
Jonathan,"Need you to stay real still. Here, you're gonna want to bite down on this, okay?"
Dustin,"Jesus Christ. Holy shit. Holy shit."
Jonathan,"Do it."
Mike,"Okay."
Dustin,"Jonathan!"
Nancy,"Stop talking! No! Stop it!"
Eleven,"Stop! Stop! I can do it. I can do it. God! God!"
Mike,"The Mind Flayer, it built this monster in Hawkins, to stop El, to kill her and pave a way into our world."
Nancy,"And it almost did. That was just one tiny piece of it."
Hopper,"How big is this thing?"
Jonathan,"It's big."
Lucas,"Yeah."
Jonathan,"Thirty feet, at least."
Lucas,"It sorta destroyed your cabin. Sorry."
Steve,"Okay, so, just to be clear, this... this big fleshy spider thing that hurt El, it's some kind of gigantic... weapon?"
Nancy,"Yes."
Steve,"But instead of, like, screws and metal, the Mind Flayer made its weapon..."
Nancy,"with melted people. Yes, exactly."
Steve,"Yeah, okay. I... Yeah, I'm just making sure."
Joyce,"Are we sure this thing is still out there, still alive?"
Will,"El beat the shit out of it, but, yeah, it's still alive."
Max,"But if we close the gate again..."
Will,"We cut the brain off from the body."
Lucas,"And kill it."
Hopper,"Theoretically."
Murray,"Yoo-hoo! Yoo-hoo! Okay, this is what Alexei called 'the hub.' Now, the hub takes us to the vault room."
Hopper,"Okay, where's the gate?"
Murray,"Right here. I don't know the scale on this, but I think it's fairly close to the vault room, maybe 50 feet or so."
Erica,"More like 500. What, you're just gonna waltz in there like it's commie Disneyland or something?"
Murray,"I'm sorry, who are you?"
Erica,"Erica Sinclair. Who are you?"
Murray,"Murray... Bauman."
Erica,"Listen, Mr. Bunman, I'm not trying to tell you how to do things, but I've been down in that shithole for 24 hours. And with all due respect, you do what this man tells you, you're all gonna die."
Murray,"I'm sorry, why is this four-year-old speaking to me?"
Erica,"Um, I'm ten, you bald bastard!"
Lucas,"Erica!"
Erica,"Just the facts!"
Dustin,"She's right. You're all gonna die, but you don't have to. Excuse me. Sorry, may I?"
Hopper,"Please."
Dustin,"Okay, see this room here? This is a storage facility. There's a hatch in here that feeds into their underground ventilation system. That will lead you to the base of the weapon. It's a bit of a maze down there, but between me and Erica, we can show you the way."
Hopper,"You can show us the way?"
Dustin,"Don't worry, you can do all the fighting and the dangerous hero shit, and we'll just be your... navigators."
Hopper,"No. Nope."
Erica,"Well, that settles it. He's gonna die. They're gonna die."
Dustin,"Yep, most likely."
Lucas,"You guys survived."
Dustin,"Barely."
Hopper,"We could've really used you guys down there."
Steve,"Could've used you up here, too."
Lucas,"Yeah, man. We missed you, dude."
Will,"Yeah. Big-time."
Dustin,"I missed you guys, too. Big-time."
Erica,"Please don't cry, nerds."
Lucas,"Erica."
Erica,"Keep saying my name, see what happens."
Hopper,"Hey, heads up. You can navigate, just from someplace safe."
Dustin,"It's not that simple."
Erica,"The signal won't reach. Not with this. You need something with a high enough frequency band to relay with the Russians' radio tower. But for that to work, you need someone who has both seen their comms room and has access to a super-powered handcrafted radio tower, one preferably already situated at the highest point in Hawkins. Oh, wait. That's me."
Dustin,"If you want us to navigate, you got us. But we need a head start. And a car."
Steve,"Oh, man, now this... this is what I'm talkin' about!"
Robin,"Toddfather?"
Steve,"Oh, screw Todd! Steve's her daddy now."
Robin,"Did you just talk about yourself in the third person?"
Erica,"Did he just call himself daddy?"
Steve,"All right, where are we going?"
Dustin,"Weathertop."
Steve,"Weather-what?"
Dustin,"Just drive."
Steve,"Okay. Jesus!"
Joyce,"Bottom lock, second-to-top lock, third-to-top lock, top lock. Listen to me, I need to end this, but I will be back before you know it, okay?"
Will,"I don't know, Mom."
Joyce,"No, listen. You're gonna be safe there. It's... It's far away from all this. You just stick close to your brother and... and do whatever he says. No matter what. Okay?"
Will,"I'm not worried about me, Mom, I'm worried about you."
Joyce,"Oh, honey, I'm gonna be fine. Okay? I'm gonna be fine."
Will,"Okay, Mom."
Jonathan,"Okay, Mom. That's enough."
Joyce,"I'm gonna be fine."
Will,"Okay. Mom, I can't breathe."
Joyce,"My battery's low, but..."
Will,"You're suffocating me."
Joyce,"...it will recharge."
Hopper,"I know it will, kid. I know."
Eleven,"I can fight."
Hopper,"Better than any of us. But right now, I need you safe. This thing is after you. It's not after me. Do you understand? Hey... I need you to understand. Okay?"
Mike,"Hey. We should probably go. Mike?"
Eleven,"Be careful."
Murray,"It's a two-man operation. Two!"
Hopper,"Yeah, well, change of plans."
Murray,"Change of plans?"
Hopper,"Yeah. Will you explain it to him, please?"
Joyce,"We have two options here, Jim. We can turn the machine off, or we can explode it."
Murray,"Oh, yeah, says who?"
Joyce,"Says the man who built it!"
Murray,"Yeah, and we wanna explode it!"
Joyce,"Or else our heroic efforts will be for naught! This is a three-man operation, Jim, not two."
Murray,"Yeah, three."
Mike,"El, you're bleeding. Are you okay?"
Eleven,"Yeah."
Mike,"Here. Okay. Here. Lay down."
Nancy,"What's wrong?"
Jonathan,"I don't... I don't know."
Nancy,"You can't be serious. Come on! Didn't your mom just buy this car?"
Jonathan,"Yes. I'm sure it's fine."
Nancy,"Did you leave the lights on?"
Jonathan,"No."
Nancy,"Do we have gas?"
Jonathan,"Yes!"
Nancy,"Come on!"
Jonathan,"Whoa, whoa, whoa! Just stop, stop!"
Nancy,"Pop the hood."
Jonathan,"What the hell?"
Nancy,"What?"
Jonathan,"The ignition cable's gone."
Nancy,"Back in the mall! Back in the mall! Go! Go, go, go!"
Mike,"Be careful!"
Nancy,"Go! Go! Go, go, go!"
Jonathan,"Go, go, go!"
Murray,"So then I yank those cables like I'm pulling weeds."
Joyce,"And that'll set off the alarm..."
Murray,"According to Alexei, may his soul rest in peace. Which should give you two an opening to retrieve the keys from the vault."
Joyce,"And then we just follow the map to the observation room, turn the key..."
Murray,"Kaboom, we blow this sucker sky-high."
Joyce,"Yeah. And then, once the rift is closed, we escape back through the vents."
Murray,"Right under their commie noses."
Joyce,"Then home free."
Murray,"Uh..."
Hopper,"Oh, God, just because it wasn't your plan doesn't mean it was a bad plan."
Murray,"I didn't say it was a bad plan."
Hopper,"You made a noise."
Murray,"I did not make a noise."
Hopper,"You did too."
Murray,"I really think it's disrespectful..."
Hopper,"What is up with you and noises?"
Murray,"Children! Children! It is a good plan. A solid B, which is laudable, given the situation and time constraints. Dare I say, if it all goes right..."
Russian Soldier 1,"Stop right there!"
Russian Soldier 2,"Don't shoot! Don't shoot!"
Murray,"Documents, important documents... for the Lieutenant-Comrade! He called us, last minute. Pardon our sloppy appearance."
Russian Soldier 3,"Lieutenant? What Lieutenant?"
Murray,"Lieutenant... Molotov?"
Hopper,"Oh, shit."
Murray,"Jim..."
Joyce,"This is crazy."
Hopper,"Oh, my God."
Joyce,"Jim, I... This..."
Hopper,"I had it under control."
Joyce,"Yeah, sure you did. What are you doing?"
Hopper,"I'm improvising."
Steve,"Jesus, how far is this place, man?"
Dustin,"Relax, we're almost there."
Steve,"Suzie must be pretty special, huh? I mean, if you built this thing and lugged it all the way to the middle of nowhere just to talk to her?"
Dustin,"I mean, nobody's scientifically perfect, but Suzie's about as close to being perfect as any human could possibly be."
Erica,"She sound made-up to me. She sound made-up to you?"
Steve,"Why are you hesitating, Steve? I'm... I'm... I'm not! I'm not! I think she sounds real. You know, totally, absolutely real."
Dustin,"Left. Turn left."
Steve,"There's not a road here."
Dustin,"Turn left now!"
Steve,"Jesus! Hang on! Henderson, where are we going?!"
Dustin,"Up!"
Robin,"Oh, Jesus!"
Steve,"We're not gonna make it!"
Dustin,"Yes, we are. Come on, baby. Come on, baby!"
Steve,"Come on! Come on. Come on! Guess the Toddfather has its limitations."
Mike,"Scoops Troop, do you copy? Scoops Troop, do you copy? Scoops Troop, do you copy? Scoops Troop, I repeat, do you copy? We're trapped in the mall and in need of emergency transportation. Scoops Troop, do you copy? Billy has found us. He has disabled our car and we are trapped in the mall. Repeat: Billy has disabled our car and we are trapped in the mall. Scoops Troop..."
Max,"You're gonna kill him, aren't you?"
Hopper,"This is just a precaution, okay?"
Max,"And not just against Billy. If he knows we're here, so does the Mind Flayer."
Mike,"Scoops Troop, I repeat, we are in need of emergency transportation. Do you copy? Scoops Troop, do you copy?"
Jonathan,"No chance that thing'll drive, right?"
Mike,"Steve, do you copy?"
Dustin,"We don't need it to drive."
Mike,"Dustin!"
Dustin,"We just need the ignition cable."
Jonathan,"Push!"
Will,"Shit!"
Jonathan,"Let me try. El..."
Eleven,"I can do it."
Russian Soldier 4,"Can I help?"
Russian Soldier 5,"Picking up."
Russian Soldier 6,"Do I know you?"
Russian Soldier 7,"New arrivals. Landed last night."
Russian Soldier 6,"Say goodbye to sunlight."
Russian Soldier 7,"Who needs sunlight when we have one another, comrade?"
Russian Soldier 6,"Indeed, comrade!"
Russian Soldier 7,"And a bottle of Stolichnaya."
Hopper,"Why are you talking so much?"
Murray,"He was nice."
Hopper,"He was nice?"
Murray,"He was a nice guard."
Hopper,"Yeah, I mean, we should probably invite him over after all this is done."
Joyce,"Yeah, I can bake him a casserole."
Hopper,"Get a six-pack, share some laughs. You know, have a drink."
Murray,"Anyone wanna trade jobs?"
Dustin,"Bald Eagle, do you copy? Bald Eagle, I repeat, this is Scoops Troop, do you copy?"
Murray,"Yes, I copy."
Dustin,"Call sign?"
Murray,"Bald Eagle."
Dustin,"Please repeat."
Murray,"Bald Eagle. This is Bald Eagle!"
Dustin,"Copy that."
Dustin,"Good to hear your voice, Bald Eagle. What's your 20?"
Murray,"We reached the vent. I'll contact you when I need you. Until then, silence."
Dustin,"Roger that, Bald Eagle. This is Scoops Troop, going radio silent. 10-10, over."
Murray,"I hate children."
Murray,"Remember, if anyone says anything, just..."
Hopper,"Smile and nod."
Murray,"Good luck."
Jonathan,"Push! All right, great. All right, now, all the way. Ready? Three, two, one... Push!"
Dustin,"Told you. Physics."
Nancy,"How do we get it open?"
Jonathan,"Uh, there should be a latch. Check under the wheel. You see it?"
Nancy,"I don't know, hold on."
Max,"What's she doing?"
Mike,"El."
Mike,"Are you okay?"
Jonathan,"We're almost out!"
Nancy,"I know!"
Dustin,"Hurry! Close it now! Close it!"
Mike,"Mike... Mike. Mike."
Max,"Mike. Mike. Mike, get up. Mike, can you hear me? Mike! Mike! Hey, come on. You okay?"
Mike,"Where's El?"
Young Billy,"Leave me alone!"
Billy's Mom,"Stop it!"
Young Billy,"Mom!"
Billy's Dad,"This is your new sister."
Young Billy,"...at least seven feet."
Eleven,"Seven... feet. You told her... the wave was seven feet."
Billy's Mom,"Woo! Yeah!"
Eleven,"You ran to her, on the beach. There were seagulls. She wore a hat... with a blue ribbon. A long dress... with a blue and red flower. Yell... Yellow sandals, covered in sand. She was pretty. She was really pretty. And you... you were happy."
Grigori,"I'll see you in hell!"
Nancy,"Hit me. We're out!"
Jonathan,"Damn it!"
Billy,"No! Sorry."
Max,"Close it now! Close it! Billy? Billy. Billy, Billy, get up, please. Billy, get up, please, please. Billy... Billy, wake up. Billy, get up. Please, Billy... Billy! Billy... Billy... It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay."
Joyce,"Hop. Jim. Where's Jim?"
Soldier,"Let's go! Go! Come on!"
Murray,"You all right?"
Joyce,"Don't shoot! American! We're Americans! Americans!"
Male Reporter,"Welcome to Hawkins, Indiana, a wonderful place to grow up, to raise your family, to walk your dog. But then... on July Fourth, everything changed. A terrible tragedy struck this small town. But this was not this small town's first brush with tragedy. Mysterious deaths, government cover-ups, a bizarre chemical leak. Is it all linked? All a vast conspiracy? The fault of a disgraced, corrupt mayor? Or is something more going on in the heartland? Can a town itself be cursed? Some believe a rise in Satanism is to blame. To find out, tune in tonight at 8:00 p.m. for 'Horror in the Heartland' on Cutting Edge."
Steve,"You put your mom down as a reference?"
Robin,"Yeah. Why not? She's, like, super well-respected."
Robin,"You're such a dingus."
Steve,"Wha..."
Robin,"Uh, just to be clear, we weren't fired, you know. The mall burned down and, like, killed a bunch of people."
Keith,"Thanks for sharing. Didn't know."
Keith,"Three favorite movies. Go."
Robin,"Uh... The Apartment, Hidden Fortress, Children of Paradise."
Keith,"You, go."
Steve,"Favorite movies?"
Keith,"Did I stutter?"
Steve,"Uh... Animal House, for sure."
Robin,"Um... Eyes on me, Harrington."
Steve,"Yeah. Uh... Star Wars."
Keith,"A New Hope?"
Steve,"A new what-now?"
Keith,"Which Star Wars?"
Steve,"The one with the teddy bears. Duh. No? Uh... Oh, the one that just came out. The movie that just came out. The one with the DeLorean and Alex P. Keaton, and he's trying to bang his mom. The time... Yeah, those are my top three. Classics."
Keith,"You start Monday."
Keith,"You start never."
Robin,"Will you just, um... Will you give us a minute?"
Steve,"Why?"
Robin,"Steve."
Robin,"All right, you have to understand, Keith, I know his taste is a bit pedestrian, but the dingus has other qualities."
Keith,"He's a douchebag of the highest order, Robin."
Robin,"He was a bit of a prick to us in high school, I'll grant you that, but he remains... a total chick magnet."
Keith,"Yeah, okay, and this is relevant to me how?"
Robin,"Uh, Earth to Keith. The ladies will come in just to see him. They'll come in in droves. Droves, Keith. We sold so much ice cream, they had to get a second shipment in from Michigan. Goddamn Michigan, Keith. And these ladies... These ladies are hot. They're so very hot. And there are too many of them for little Steve. He needs assistance. He needs your assistance, Keith."
Keith,"What's in it for you? You got a thing for him or something?"
Steve,"Goddammit. This is..."
Robin,"We're just, um... We're just friends."
Steve,"Oh! Fast Times. Fast Times. Ever heard of it?"
Robin,"Top three for me, Keith."
Steve,"Whoa, whoa, whoa! Slow down."
Robin,"Sorry. Sorry."
Steve,"Still got it?"
Robin,"Yeah, yeah."
Max,"Turn around"
Lucas,"Turn around"
Max,"Look at what you see"
Lucas,"Look at what you see"
Max,"In her face"
Lucas,"In her face"
Max,"The mirror of your dreams"
Lucas,"The mirror of your dreams"
Max,"Rhymes that keep their secrets"
Lucas,"Rhymes that keep their secrets"
Max,"Will unfold behind the clouds"
Lucas,"Will unfold behind the clouds"
Max,"Wait, did we get that verse right? It's 'unfold behind the clouds'?"
Lucas,"Yeah, but you're butchering it, so could you please stop?"
Max,"So then join in, Dusty-bun."
Lucas,"Yeah, come on, Dusty-bun, why don't you join us?"
Dustin,"You guys are so funny, you should be on Carson."
Max,"Can't we just hear your rendition?"
Dustin,"No."
Max,"Please? Just one verse?"
Dustin,"No. No way. It's reserved for Suzie's ears and Suzie's ears alone."
Max,"Turn around"
Lucas,"Turn around"
Max,"Look at what you see"
Lucas,"Look at what you see"
Max,"In their face"
Lucas,"In their face"
Max,"The mirror of your dreams"
Lucas,"The mirror of your dreams"
Max,"Rhymes that keep their secrets"
Dustin,"Stop! You guys, please, shut up."
Mike,"Whoa, dude. That's the donation box."
Will,"I know. I'll just use yours when I come back."
Mike,"I mean, if we still wanna play."
Will,"Yeah, but what if you want to join another party?"
Mike,"Not possible."
Jonathan,"Is that... everything?"
Nancy,"I guess so."
Jonathan,"Seventeen years of my life... packed up in one day."
Nancy,"What if I just... don't let you go?"
Jonathan,"I think... the new owners might kick us out."
Nancy,"You could stay in our basement."
Jonathan,"Your dad'd love that."
Nancy,"We could hide you in a tent, like El."
Nancy,"Hey. It's gonna be okay."
Jonathan,"As a wise man once said... we've got shared trauma."
Nancy,"So what's a little more, right?"
Jonathan,"What's a little more?"
Mike,"They'll come back. I know they will."
Eleven,"Thanks."
Mike,"You packed your walkie, right?"
Eleven,"Yes."
Mike,"Because you know that I'm gonna steal Cerebro from Dustin and call you so much, you're gonna have to turn it off, right? Did you talk to your mom?"
Eleven,"About Thanksgiving?"
Mike,"Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I got the okay. I'll be there. And then I was thinking maybe you could come up here for Christmas. And Will, too. You can come before or after Christmas, or whatever Mrs. Byers wants, but I was thinking Christmas Day could be super fun, because we'd all have cool new presents to play with and, uh... Sorry, that made me sound like a seven-year-old."
Eleven,"I like presents, too."
Mike,"Yeah, cool. Yeah. I like... I like presents, too. Cool."
Eleven,"Mike?"
Mike,"Yeah?"
Eleven,"Remember that day... at the cabin, you were talking to Max?"
Mike,"Um... I don't think I follow."
Eleven,"You talked about your... your feelings, your heart."
Mike,"Oh. Oh, yeah, that. Man, that was so long ago. Um... That was really heat of the moment stuff, and we were arguing and... I don't really remember... What did I say, exactly?"
Eleven,"Mike... I love you, too."
Joyce,"Donation box?"
Eleven,"Uh, yeah, sure."
Eleven,"What is that?"
Joyce,"Uh... It... It's the speech Hop wrote for you and Mike."
Eleven,"Speech?"
Joyce,"Yeah. You know, the heart-to-heart."
Eleven,"He never talked to you, did he? Can I read?"
Hopper,"There's something I've been wanting to talk to you both about. I know this is a difficult conversation, but I care about you both very much. And I know that you care about each other very much. And that's why it's important that we set these boundaries moving forward, so we can build an environment... where we all feel... comfortable... trusted... and open... to sharing our feelings. Feelings. Feelings. Jesus. The truth is, for so long, I'd forgotten what those even were. I've been stuck in one place, in a cave, you might say. A deep, dark cave. And then, I left some Eggos out in the woods, and you came into my life and... for the first time in a long time, I started to feel things again. I started to feel happy. But, lately, I guess I've been feeling... distant from you. Like you're... you're pulling away from me or something. I miss playing board games every night, making triple-decker Eggo extravaganzas at sunrise, watching westerns together before we doze off. But I know you're getting older. Growing. Changing. And I guess... if I'm being really honest, that's what scares me. I don't want things to change. So, I think maybe that's why I came in here, to try to maybe... stop that change. To turn back the clock. To make things go back to how they were. But I know that's naive. It's just... not how life works. It's moving. Always moving, whether you like it or not. And, yeah, sometimes it's painful. Sometimes it's sad. And sometimes... it's surprising. Happy. So, you know what? Keep on growing up, kid. Don't let me stop you. Make mistakes, learn from 'em, and when life hurts you, because it will, remember the hurt. The hurt is good. It means you're out of that cave. But, please, if you don't mind, for the sake of your poor old dad, keep the door open three inches."
Jonathan,"Are you okay?"
Eleven,"Yeah."
Eleven,"Time to go?"
Jonathan,"Yeah."
Eleven,"I'll be out in a minute."
Jonathan,"Okay."
Russian Guard,"No. Not the American."
Prisoner,"No, I'm begging you... No! Don't! No! Please! No! Don't! No, don't! Don't do this! Let me go! Let me go! Don't leave me in here. Let me out, I'm innocent. I'm innocent! I'm begging you, please!"
