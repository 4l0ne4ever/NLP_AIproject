Unknown,"What have you done? What have you done?"
Brenner,"All done. Not so bad, was it? See? There's nothing to be afraid of. Is there, Nancy?"
Brenner,"Why don't you take a seat?"
Unknown,"Nancy, just stay with me. Stay with me, okay?"
Unknown,"Whatever you guys are doing, hurry up!"
Unknown,"Steve says you need to hurry!"
Unknown,"Yeah? No shit! We're trying. We can't find anything."
Unknown,"What is all this shit? What are you even looking for?"
Unknown,"Madonna, Blondie, Bowie, Beatles? Music! We need music!"
Unknown,"This is music!"
Vecna,"Nancy. What are you doing? It's not time for you to leave."
Vecna,"Now that you've seen where I've been… I would like very much to show you where I am going."
Vecna,"Take a seat, Nancy."
Vecna,"I… Want you to tell Eleven. I want you to tell her everything you see."
Vecna,"Tell her… everything."
Unknown,"Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay."
Steve,"It's okay. I'm here. I'm right here."
Unknown,"What's going on there? Get the power back on!"
Unknown,"Tell him that the prisoners are contained… and that you're working on the power."
Unknown,"Tell him!"
Unknown,"And that door there, where does it lead?"
Unknown,"To... to cell block two..."
Unknown,"No cell blocks! I need a safe way out of here."
Unknown,"Guess you got my message, huh?"
Joyce,"Oh, no, I just have always wanted to visit the Soviet Union. With Murray."
Unknown,"You two getting along?"
Joyce,"He's the Star sky to my Hutch."
Unknown,"I thought you were dead."
Joyce,"Thought I lost you. I did lose you. For eight months. We had a funeral."
Unknown,"Anybody show?"
Joyce,"Are you kidding? You're the hero of Hawkins."
Joyce,"It's true."
Hopper,"Yeah, I always felt I'd be easier to like when I was dead."
Unknown,"How about El?"
Joyce,"She's good. She misses her dad. We all do."
Murray,"Uh, I hate to interrupt, but apparently, they can climb too."
Unknown,"Lower your weapons. Lower your weapons! Don't shoot!"
Unknown,"Stop!"
Antonov,"The hell is that?"
Murray,"Please tell me they don't have another one of those things."
Unknown,"You can't go in there! It's dangerous!"
Unknown,"It's dangerous!"
Unknown,"Oh my God."
Unknown,"The hell are they doing?"
Antonov,"Hey. Found something."
Hopper,"Think this'll lead us outta here?"
Unknown,"I give it a hundred to one odds."
Unknown,"And one, two, three. And one, two, three. Again. One, two, three."
Unknown,"Pulse is dropping. One-fifty now. BP's 160…"
Unknown,"How do you feel?"
Owens,"Can you hear us? Eleven. Can you hear us?"
Unknown,"No, leave her."
Terry,"Hi, Jane."
Jonathan,"Holy shit, dude. Check it out. I didn't know they expanded into Nevada."
Jonathan,"Watch out, Domino's. Your dominoes are gonna fall."
Will,"How far is Nina from Vegas?"
Jonathan,"From Vegas? Um, as long as Suzie's coordinates are right, about another 90 miles. Why?"
Will,"Well, once we save her, El, we should stop on the way back. El could make us, like, super rich, and we'd never have to work. We could just play D&D and Nintendo for the rest of our lives."
Jonathan,"Yeah. Totally."
Will,"We're gonna make it, Mike. She's gonna be okay."
Mike,"Yeah, I know. I… I know she is. But… But what if after all this is over, she… Sh… she doesn't need me anymore?"
Will,"No, o… of course she'll still need you. She'll always need you, Mike."
Mike,"I keep telling myself that, but I… I don't believe it. I mean, she's special. She was born special. Maybe I was one of the first people to realize that. But the truth is, when I stumbled on her in the woods, she just needed someone. It's not fate. It's… It's not destiny. It's just simple dumb luck. And one day she's gonna realize I'm just some random nerd that got lucky that Superman landed on his doorstep. I mean, at least Lois Lane is an ace reporter for the Daily Planet, right? But…"
Will,"Sorry. No. No, I… it's so stupid, given everything that's going on. It's just… I… I don't know, I just… Uh… You're scared of losing her."
Mike,"Can I show you something?"
Mike,"This is amazing. Did you paint this?"
Will,"Yeah. Yeah. I mean… I mean, El asked me to. She commissioned it, basically. I mean, she told me what to draw. Anyway, my point is, see how you're leading us here? You're guiding the whole party, inspiring us. That… That's what you do. And see your coat of arms here? It's a heart. And I know it's sort of on the nose, but that's what holds this party together. Heart. Because, I mean, without heart, we'd all fall apart. Even El. Especially El. These past few months, she's been so lost without you. It's just, she's so different from other people, and… when you're… when you're different, sometimes… you feel like a mistake. But you make her feel like she's not a mistake at all. Like she's better for being different. And that gives her the courage to fight on. If she was mean to you or she seemed like she was pushing you away, it's because she's scared of losing you, like you're scared of losing her. And if she was going to lose you, I… I think she'd rather just get it over with quick. Like ripping off a Band-Aid. So, yeah, El needs you, Mike. And she always will."
Mike,"Yeah?"
Will,"Yeah."
Brenner,"After the attack, you fell into a coma. Like One, you had pushed yourself beyond your limit. And it very nearly destroyed you. But that is where your similarities ended. What you displayed that day was beyond anything I'd ever imagined. A potential I'd only dreamed of. But when you awoke, something had been lost. Your memories, along with whatever else you'd found within yourself that day. But I knew then, just as I know today, that your powers had not been lost. They just needed a spark. But that day, you awakened something else. A doorway to another world."
Brenner,"I always thought that Henry was out there, hiding in the darkness. I didn't know for sure, not beyond a feeling. Until now. He's claimed three victims so far, and when I saw the eyes, I knew… I knew that was him. He was sending us a message, letting us know he's back. That's when I came to see you."
Eleven,"My friends."
Brenner,"Well, we… we haven't risked contact, but, as far as we know, they're… they're all safe. But I'm not gonna lie to you, Eleven. Your friends are in terrible danger. With each victim he takes, Henry is… Chiseling away at the barrier that exists between our two worlds."
Eleven,"'Chiseling'?"
Brenner,"Imagine, if you will, the barrier between our worlds is a… Concrete dam. Henry is putting cracks in this dam. Cracks in dams create pressure. Left unchecked, the pressure will build. And build. And eventually, it will reach a breaking point. And the dam will burst. And when that happens, Hawkins will fall."
Owens,"Well, that went very well, I thought. You eased her into it, nice and gentle, just like we talked about. Not ominous at all."
Nancy,"He showed me things that haven't happened yet. The most awful things. I saw a dark cloud spreading over Hawkins. Downtown on fire. Dead soldiers. And this… Giant creature with… a gaping mouth. And this creature wasn't alone. There were so many monsters. An army. And they were coming into Hawkins. Into our neighborhoods. Our homes. And then… He showed me my mom. And Holly. Mike. And they… They were all…"
Steve,"Okay, but… he's just trying to scare you, Nance. Right? I mean… I mean, it's not real."
Nancy,"Not yet. But there… there was something else. He showed me gates. Four gates. Spreading across Hawkins. And these gates, they looked like the one outside of Eddie's trailer, but… they didn't stop growing. And this wasn't the Upside Down Hawkins. This was our Hawkins. Our home."
Max,"Four chimes. Vecna's clock. It always chimes four times. Four exactly."
Nancy,"I heard them too."
Max,"He's been telling us his plan this whole time. Four kills. Four gates. End of the world."
Steve,"If that's true… He's only one kill away."
Unknown,"Oh Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ."
Steve,"Try 'em again. Try 'em again."
Dustin,"Anything?"
Max,"No. Rang a few times, then went to busy signal."
Steve,"Maybe you punched it wrong. Try again."
Max,"I didn't punch it in wrong."
Steve,"Well, I don't know."
Dustin,"I think she knows how to use a phone."
Steve,"I'm just saying, she could've typed it in wrong."
Lucas,"Same shit. How is that possible?"
Dustin,"Joyce has this telemarketer job. Always on the phone. Mike won't stop whining about it."
Max,"Yeah, but this phone's been busy for, what, three days now? That's not Joyce. No way. Something's wrong."
Nancy,"She's right. It can't be just coincidence. It can't be. Whatever's happening in Lenora is connected to all of this. I'm sure of it. But Vecna can't hurt them. Not if he's dead. We have to go back in there. Back to the Upside Down."
Steve,"Whoa, no, no, no. What?"
Unknown,"Nope."
Steve,"Let's think this through."
Nancy,"What is there to think through?"
Steve,"We barely made it out of there."
Nancy,"Yeah, because we weren't prepared. But this time, we will be. We'll get weapons and protection. We'll go through the gate, we'll find his lair, and we'll kill him."
Steve,"Or he'll kill us. The only reason you survived is because he wanted you to. He's not scared of us."
Robin,"And for good reason. We were wrong about Vecna. Henry. One."
Unknown,"Sorry, what are we calling him now?"
Dustin,"One."
Lucas,"One."
Max,"Vecna."
Nancy,"Henry."
Unknown,"Right."
Robin,"We've learned something new about Vecna/Henry/One. He's a number like Eleven, only a sick, evil, male, child-murdering version of her with really bad skin. But my… my point is, he's super powerful. Could turn us inside out with a snap of his fingers. It's not a fair fight."
Dustin,"Then why fight fair? You're right. He's like Eleven. But that gives us an upper hand. We know Eleven's strengths. And weaknesses."
Erica,"Weaknesses?"
Dustin,"When El remote-travels, she goes into this sort of trance-like state. I bet the same is true of Vecna."
Lucas,"That would explain what he was doing in that attic."
Dustin,"Exactly. When he attacks his next victim, I'll bet you he's back in that attic, physical body defenseless."
Steve,"Defenseless? What about the army of bats?"
Dustin,"True. We'll have to find a way past them. Distract them somehow."
Eddie,"And, uh, how do we do that, exactly?"
Jonathan,"Give me the coordinates."
Will,"Um, okay. Longitude is 116 degrees, five minutes, and 17..."
Jonathan,"Slow down. Slow down."
Jonathan,"Nina! Nina. Nina?"
Argyle,"Holy macaroni. All right. You just go straight down. Like, straight… straight…"
Jonathan,"Right on the money, as I said. It just doesn't make sense."
Argyle,"Yo, dudes! My dudes! Jesus Christ. Come check this shit out!"
Jonathan,"What is it?"
Argyle,"Gotta see it to believe it, my dudes! Come on! Hurry! Let's go! Let's go! Let's go! Pronto!"
Jonathan,"Okay. So no small woman named Nina. But you said any signs of life, am I right?"
Argyle,"Right. Well, these are no regular tire tracks, brochachos. I mean, look at the tread on these monsters. They're fatties. And you know what that means."
Jonathan,"Military."
Argyle,"We gotta go."
Unknown,"Well, I wouldn't do it if I didn't think she was ready. But either way, I don't think we have any other choice."
Owens,"Do you?"
Unknown,"No, I don't."
Owens,"Yeah. It might take me some time though."
Unknown,"Just… As fast as you can. It's gonna take us two hours to get to Nellis as it is. And, Ellen, one more favor. Can you send somebody over to a Max Mayfield's house? There are some kids there that just need looking after, okay?"
Owens,"Ellen? Hello? Sam? Hello?"
Unknown,"Why the long face, Doc? We just wanna talk."
Unknown,"No! Wait! No! No! What…"
Brenner,"You can't leave, Eleven."
Eleven,"Where is Dr. Owens?"
Brenner,"Dr. Owens had a change of heart. I know you wish to go to him, and there's nothing I can do to stop you from forcing open that door. But if my men hear you coming, they will kill him. And alone, you will never find your way out of this desert to your friends. Here's what we're going to do. You and I are going to complete our work together. And when I decide that you are ready, we will return to Hawkins, together. Papa and daughter."
Eleven,"Why are you doing this?"
Brenner,"Because there's no other choice."
Eleven,"There is a choice. Only one that is right."
Brenner,"And you make the right choices?"
Eleven,"I try. Did you make the right choice with Mama?"
Brenner,"Four-fifty. Your mother was sick, Eleven. She was a danger to herself and to others. She brought a gun into the hospital. She killed a man."
Eleven,"Hospital? No. A prison."
Brenner,"Everything I have done was for your own good. For your own protection."
Eleven,"And Henry? You kept Henry in that lab. With the children. Was that for our good? Was that a right choice?"
Brenner,"I had no idea what Henry would do. I cared for you. I loved you. I loved all of you."
Eleven,"Even Henry?"
Brenner,"Yes. I was trying to help Henry, to understand him. Yes. Yes, I cared for him. Even after what… what he did? Yes. Because I knew I had failed him."
Eleven,"So this morning, you said you believed he was always alive in the darkness. Is that why I was searching the darkness? Was I looking for him? For Henry?"
Brenner,"No. No. We were focused on the Soviets. You knew that."
Eleven,"'Papa does not tell the truth.' Henry said that."
Brenner,"And now you trust Henry? Henry, who's manipulated you like some puppet? You are the one who released him from his prison. You. And now you are angry with yourself and you're taking your anger out on me and you're risking everything."
Eleven,"No. No, you. You have risked everything! You have lied! You made me look for him! The gate. The Mind Flayer. So many dead. And all because of you. Because you could not stop. You could not let him go."
Eleven,"I came here to try and understand who I was. To see if I… If I was the monster. And now I know the truth. It is not me. It is you. You are the monster."
Eleven,"I am going to open that door, and I am going to leave with Dr. Owens. If you try to stop me, I will kill you."
Brenner,"You'll soon see the truth, Eleven."
Unknown,"Is this legal?"
Unknown,"Actually, I think it's a felony."
Unknown,"Right."
Eddie,"But it guarantees one thing. I won't miss."
Dustin,"How's she feeling?"
Eddie,"Light. But durable. Deadly. But reliable."
Eddie,"Hear me now. There will be no more retreating… from Eddie the Banished."
Dustin,"Hey, you're really ready for bat-tle. You get it? 'Bat-tle.' B-A-T. No?"
Eddie,"What are you doing? You son of a bitch!"
Dustin,"No wedgies! No wedgies!"
Eddie,"Never change, Dustin Henderson. Promise me?"
Dustin,"I wasn't planning on it."
Eddie,"Good. Good. Hey, Sinclairs. How are those, uh… those spears coming on?"
Erica,"Flip that damn thumb around."
Lucas,"What?"
Erica,"It's too loose, Lucas. This isn't a basketball game where they blow the whistle when your shoes fall off."
Lucas,"Okay, okay, for the record, my shoes never fell off."
Erica,"Okay, for the record, it's kinda hard for your shoes to fall off when you're riding the bench. Yet, for some reason, you show up to every game."
Lucas,"Mmm, except the one that mattered. Plus, Mom and Dad forced me."
Erica,"Bull. Mom and Dad can't force you to do shit. Well, even though you're a bench-riding loser, you're still my brother. Just the facts."
Steve,"It just doesn't make sense."
Robin,"What doesn't make sense?"
Steve,"That was Dan Shelter. He graduated, like, two years ago."
Robin,"So?"
Steve,"So he's in college. Which means he was visiting on spring break. Fast Times was returned, like, I don't know, a week ago? Right? Unless she's got some horn dog brother we don't know about. Which is possible. Or she's just really into Judge Reinhold?"
Robin,"Steve. Nah. I don't care. I don't understand why you do either with everything that's going on. Honestly, this feels like a perfect time for that little pull of the rug because… In the face of the world ending, the stakes of my love life feel spectacularly low."
Steve,"Yeah. I mean, I get you there, but… I still have hope."
Robin,"Not everything has a happy ending."
Steve,"Yeah, yeah, believe me, I know."
Robin,"I'm not talking about failed romance. I just… I have this terrible, gnawing feeling that… It might not work out for us this time."
Steve,"You think we shouldn't be doing this?"
Robin,"I think we're mad fools, the lot of us, but… if we don't stop him, who will? We have to try, right?"
Steve,"Yeah."
Robin,"To killing Vecna."
Steve,"Slash Henry."
Robin,"Slash One."
Brenner,"It's only a precaution, Eleven. I never intend to activate it. I very much hope our fighting has come to an end."
Brenner,"Shh. Shh. I know. You're angry with me. But it was the only way. The best way."
Unknown,"What's going on?"
Soldier,"It's Sullivan. They found us."
Soldier,"Go, go, go!"
Unknown,"Three! Two! One!"
Soldier,"Go to the back! Get moving!"
Soldier,"Move out! Go! Get 'em out of here! No more time! Evacuate now!"
Soldier,"Clear. Clear!"
Soldier,"Quarter and search by twos. Hicks, take the upper level."
Soldier,"Yes, sir."
Soldier,"Sir? We found something you're gonna wanna see."
Sullivan,"Well, well. And what happened here? Hmm? Are Mommy and Daddy fighting? Okay. Let's try this again, shall we? Where's the girl?"
Sullivan,"Where do you think you're going, Doc?"
Soldier,"Why don't you give 'em some lead?"
Soldier,"I got it."
Soldier,"Down he goes."
Soldier,"Victor-Two-Sierra, this is Charlie-Lima-Golf. Do you copy, over?"
Soldier,"Victor-Two-Sierra, I copy, over."
Soldier,"We've got the target in our sights. Requesting permission to take the shot, over."
Owens,"Jack, you don't have to do this. It's over, Sam. Wait! Wait! Wait! I can put her in a coma. A medically induced coma. We have the drugs. We can do it right here. And we'll see if… if these murders keep happening. If you're right, the killing ends, and you can pull the plug on her. In fact, I'll do it myself. But if you're wrong about this, God, are we gonna need her."
Owens,"Jack. Don't do this. I'm begging you."
Sullivan,"Take it."
Owens,"You son of a bitch! No! You son of a bitch!"
Sullivan,"Green light. Light her up."
Soldier,"Civvies. Five o'clock."
Unknown,"The hell?"
Mike,"There she is! There she is! On the ground!"
Argyle,"What are those dudes doing on the ground? Is that blood, man?"
Unknown,"Shit."
Soldier,"Victor-Two-Sierra, we've got a civvy headed our way."
Soldier,"Ignore it. Just take out the girl."
Soldier,"Copy that. Ignore the civvy. Take the shot."
Eleven,"Found ya."
Soldier,"Hell are you doing? Hold her steady!"
Soldier,"I don't know, man. Something's wrong!"
Unknown,"Jesus Christ."
Unknown,"Holy shit! Shit!"
Soldier,"I'm losing her!"
Soldier,"Shit! Shit! I can't! I can't hold it!"
Argyle,"Shit. Shit. Shit."
Will,"Eleven. You… Are you okay?"
Eleven,"I'm okay. Okay."
Jonathan,"Hey, guys. We gotta go. We gotta get you outta here."
Eleven,"Papa."
Brenner,"Eleven. I want you to know I'm proud of you. So very proud. You are my family. My child. I've only ever wanted to help you. To protect you. Everything I did, I did for you. I need you to understand. Please tell me you understand. Please."
Eleven,"Goodbye, Papa."
Eleven,"We need to get to Hawkins."
Mike,"I know. And we will. But we need to get you somewhere safe. Gonna be people behind us."
Eleven,"No, Mike, we need to get to Hawkins tonight."
Mike,"We'll never make it. That's over 2,000 miles."
Eleven,"We need to find a way. If we don't, they are going to die."
Mike,"Who's gonna die? El, who's gonna die?"
