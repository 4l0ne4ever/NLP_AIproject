Argyle,"Shit! Oh, shit! Oh, shit! Oh, shit!"
Mike,"God. Come on. Shit."
Jonathan,"Keep pressure on it. It's not slowing. Keep putting pressure on it."
Will,"More napkins."
Argyle,"I don't think praying's gonna help that dude."
Jonathan,"No, you idiot! St. Mary's Hospital."
Harmon,"No, no. No hospital."
Jonathan,"We're gonna get you to the hospital."
Harmon,"You need to warn… …O… Owens. The girl. She… She's in danger."
Mike,"Okay, how… how do we find Owens?"
Harmon,"Nina. Nina."
Will,"Come on. A pen."
Jonathan,"Okay. Here's the number."
Mike,"Shit. He wants to write something. Grab a magazine or something. Will, get something. Write the number."
Jonathan,"He's really bleeding a lot. Hey! Look at me! Hey! Come on!"
Argyle,"Hey, yo, yo. Wait, wait, wait. Why is it so quiet back there, huh? Yo, is he dead? Jesus, man."
Jonathan,"Talk to me! Shit! We should get off the road. Argyle, Ar… Argyle, get off the road, now!"
Argyle,"Shit, he's dead, isn't he? This is real bad."
Jonathan,"What are you doing?"
all,"Get off the road!"
unknown,"Listen. I know she was just here. And if you wanna live… You're gonna tell me where she is."
Owens,"Apologies for the bumpy ride, kiddo. I would've paved the road, but… Kinda ruins the whole 'top secret location' thing. Did you get some rest?"
Eleven,"A little."
Owens,"Good. I have a feeling you're gonna need it. Oop. Okay. Here we go. You didn't really think we were working out of a shed, did you? You built all this?"
Owens,"Well, more gave it a face-lift. Do you know what an ICBM is? It stands for intercontinental ballistic missile. It's a… a fancy bomb. We used to store them in these silos, but we haven't used this one in years. In fact, there… there's no bomb here at all. It's just a big ol' empty space. So we repurposed it to hold something much more powerful than a missile: you."
Owens,"Anne, Tracy. Morning."
woman,"Morning, doc. Morning."
Owens,"You'll have to forgive the staring. You're a bit of a celebrity down here."
Eleven,"I am?"
Owens,"Oh yeah. You kidding? You… You're bigger than Madonna to them. They've all given up their lives, their jobs, their families to come work on this program, 'cause they believe in the cause. They believe in you."
Owens,"It's okay. Yeah. We call her Nina."
Eleven,"What is it?"
man,"If we told you, it would ruin the surprise."
Brenner,"Hello, Eleven. I know. You're frightened of me. Perhaps, in our time apart, you may have even grown to hate me. But all I've ever wanted to do is to help you. And right now, I think you very much need my help. Your gifts have been stolen. I believe I know why. And I believe I know how to get them back. Let us work together again. You and I. Daughter and Papa."
Eleven,"Papa! No! No!"
agent,"Yeah, I got her. Why don't you go back inside? Play nice for the doctor, hmm?"
Eleven,"No! No! No! No!"
Brenner,"Leave her. I'm… I'm sorry, Eleven. This is not how I wanted things to begin. But everything's going to be all right. You're home now. You're home."
Antonov,"Enough! He is not yours to kill. Fools. What I tell you, American? No run. You don't listen. Now is going to be much pain. Much."
Antonov,"It could be worse, American. At least you have company. Your eyes don't deceive you. I'm a prisoner now. Like you. Yuri, the smuggler, he betrayed me. Betrayed us."
prisoner,"The pig's in trouble now."
Hopper,"You said we could trust him! You swore to me!"
Antonov,"Because I believed we could. You think this is what I planned? I have lost everything. Everything! We both knew the risks. Both of us."
prisoner,"Do us all a favor. Finish him!"
Antonov,"We gambled today, and we lost. We lost."
prisoner,"Finish him!"
Hopper,"Joyce. What about Joyce?"
Yuri,"There you are, my girl! Mwah! Why the long faces? Are you not excited for your journey across the Iron Curtain?"
Murray,"Yuri, I have a family. I have three kids waiting for me."
Yuri,"Did you know? Peanut butter is banned in motherland. I buy for dollar-thirty here, sell for $20 there."
Murray,"Your mother must be very proud."
Yuri,"My mother is dead. Dead… Tired of living like a bum! You see? Yuri has family too. And with money I earn from selling you, I will buy her a new house. I will buy my daughter a pony. Whatever they desire from now on, they will have. And, yes, for that, my mother will be very, very proud."
Yuri,"Hold tight. This is not American Airlines. Is going to get bit choppy."
unknown,"When'd Rick get out of jail?"
unknown,"Justice system's a goddamn joke."
Eddie,"Hey, Dustin, this is Eddie the Banished. You there? Dustin, can you hear me? Dustin? Earth to Dustin."
Nancy,"Hey, it's Nancy."
Eddie,"Wheeler! Hey. Um, I'm gonna need a food delivery, like, really soon, unless you want me going out into the world."
Nancy,"No. No, no, no. Don't do that. Stay where you are, and we'll be there as soon as we can."
Eddie,"Yeah, yeah, yeah. Listen, um… can you pick me up a six-pack? I know, it's stupid as shit, drinking right now, but a cold beer would really calm my jangled nerves."
Nancy,"Hey, I'm gonna have to call you back."
Eddie,"No, don't you da... Wheeler? Wheeler?"
Dustin,"Mm."
Nancy,"Dustin! Wake up. Aren't you supposed to be on Max watch?"
Dustin,"Yep. Yep, yep, yep. Sorry. She's right there. A second ago. I swear, I just dozed off for… an hour."
Karen,"Morning, guys. Everything okay?"
Nancy,"Yeah. Yeah, everything's okay."
Karen,"I think it's so sweet that you guys are sticking together like this. Could try sticking together at a different house for a change. You know you're welcome anytime."
Dustin,"Totally. You're like family. May I?"
Karen,"Absolutely. Yeah, why not? Take us for all we're worth."
Dustin,"Okay."
Nancy,"Hey."
Max,"Hey. Just couldn't sleep. People kept blasting music in my ears, for some reason. But Holly let me borrow some of her crayons. We've been having fun, right, Holly?"
Holly,"Mm-hmm."
Nancy,"Is this what you saw last night?"
Max,"I mean, it's supposed to be. I thought it'd be easier to draw it out than to explain it, but… Not so much."
Nancy,"Is that…?"
Max,"It was like they were on display. And then there was this red fog everywhere. It was like a dream. A nightmare."
Dustin,"You think Vecna's just trying to scare you?"
Max,"With Billy? Yeah. But when I made it here… I dunno, something was different. He seemed surprised, almost. Like he didn't want me there."
Dustin,"Maybe you infiltrated his mind. He invaded your mind, right? Is it that big a leap to suggest you somehow wound up in his? Like Freddie Krueger's boiler room."
Max,"Freddie Krueger?"
Dustin,"He's a super burned-up dude with razors for fingers. And he kills you in your dreams."
Max,"Seriously?"
Dustin,"Sorry. It's a movie. It's not real. Just… think about it. What if you somehow unlocked a backdoor to Vecna's world? Like, maybe the answer we're looking for is somewhere in this incredibly vague drawing."
Max,"God, we need Will."
Nancy,"No shit. But I tried them again this morning, and it's the same busy signal."
Dustin,"Is this a window?"
Max,"Yeah."
Nancy,"Stained glass with roses."
Max,"Yeah. See? I'm not so terrible after all."
Nancy,"Yeah, well, it helps that I've seen it before. It's pieces of a house."
Max,"Not just any house."
Nancy,"It's Victor Creel's house. Waking the others."
Dustin,"Sorry, fuel for the road. Thanks, Mr. Wheeler!"
Eleven,"No. No."
orderly,"Well, well. Look who finally decided to join us. Someone's a sleepyhead this morning."
Eleven,"Where am I?"
orderly,"I guess you're still not quite awake, huh?"
Eleven,"Am I in Hawkins?"
orderly,"Well, well. Look who finally decided to join us. Someone's a sleepyhead this morning. Don't go too far, sleepyhead. Lessons begin promptly at 10:00."
Brenner,"Focus. Listen. Remember."
Eleven,"I'm sorry. Am I… in trouble?"
orderly,"Trouble? No. No, why do you think that? You're just missing out on all the fun. Training starts any minute. Hey. There's nothing to be nervous about. You're going to do great today. I just know it."
Brenner,"Good morning, children."
children,"Good morning, Papa."
Brenner,"How are we feeling today?"
children,"Good, Papa."
Brenner,"Good. Number Twelve. Would you be so kind and open the door?"
Twelve,"Yes, Papa."
Brenner,"Please, follow me."
woman,"Heart rate's now 120 BPM. She's rejecting it."
Brenner,"Give her time."
woman,"No, no, no. We shouldn't have just thrown her in like this. She's gonna drown in there."
Brenner,"No. No, she is going to swim."
Argyle,"Oh man. Okay. This is not the way it's supposed to go, okay? Oh man, oh man, oh man. Okay, this is so messed up. This is so messed up! This is so messed up! Okay. Dude's probably got, like, a family, kids, you know. All that shit. We gotta go to the cops with this. Lay it all on 'em. Your super powered girlfriend, bad government dudes, Upside Down dimension planet thing..."
Jonathan,"No."
Argyle,"But… But listen! The bad government dudes are after your super girlfriend, right? Right? Okay. So maybe cops can help us find out where she is."
Mike,"They're gonna kill her."
Argyle,"If they kill her, they're gonna kill us."
Jonathan,"Hey! They might kill us before they kill her."
Argyle,"I dunno, man. Don't know what order they wanna go. Eeny meeny miny moe…"
Jonathan,"Argyle! Listen! Hey! Look, I think we can figure this out, okay? We just gotta open our minds."
Argyle,"Open our minds? That's an open grave in front of me, man! Open my mind? What are you talking about?"
Jonathan,"Listen. Hey, dude! Hey! Just relax, okay? Why don't you just go to the van… …and do your thing, huh? Purple Palm Tree Delight."
Argyle,"Right. Right. It's all worn off. It's just worn off. I'm all emotional."
Jonathan,"You're emotional. Okay. You're fine."
Argyle,"I'm sorry."
Jonathan,"More weed? Is that really a good idea now?"
Mike,"Got a better idea to keep him calm?"
Jonathan,"Let's just get this done."
Eleven,"I don't understand. I don't understand!"
orderly,"Well, well. Look who finally decided to join us. Someone's a sleepyhead this morning."
Mike,"There's one. Argyle, slow down."
Argyle,"There's one what? Stop barking orders."
Mike,"Argyle! Slow down! Christ! 202-968-6161."
Will,"Is it ringing?"
Mike,"No, it's just making a bunch of weird noises."
Will,"Busy?"
Mike,"Listen to this. That remind you of anything?"
Will,"War Games."
Jonathan,"What?"
Mike,"Oh my God, we're not calling a phone. We're calling a computer."
Will,"I don't know if Nina's a computer like Joshua or Owens' lab, but Unknown Hero Agent Man gave us access to it for a reason. We just need to find the computer. We find Owens, then warn him."
Mike,"Then we warn Eleven. I just need a hacker. The only hacker that I know lives…"
Will,"In Utah. Salt Lake City, to be specific."
Mike,"Oh my God. Oh my God."
Jonathan,"What? Why 'Oh my God'?"
Argyle,"NeverEnding Story. That scared the shit out of me. The Nothing, man? That's some proper existential shit, dude."
Jonathan,"You can't be serious."
Mike,"If we take the I-15 north, we'll get there by morning."
Jonathan,"Oh, you're serious."
Mike,"I know it sounds insane, but Suzie saved the world last year. Maybe she can save it again."
Eddie,"Hey, Dustin. You there? It's Eddie. You remember me, right? Hey, if anyone's there, I really think I might be in a bit of trouble here. Okay? Wheeler? Anybody?!"
Steve,"Hey, uh, Henderson? Yeah? Could you maybe, uh, clarify what sort of clues we're supposed to be looking for here?"
Dustin,"'The world is full of obvious things which nobody by any chance ever observes.' Sherlock Holmes."
Steve,"That's great. Thanks. That's great. Really helpful. Sherlock…"
Nancy,"Whoa, whoa. What's wrong?"
Steve,"There was a spider. It's a black widow."
Nancy,"Okay. Don't go in there."
Steve,"Oh, oh. Wait, just… Something? Shit. Okay."
Nancy,"Wait. Stop moving. Stop. I just… I got it. I got it."
Steve,"Thank you. If there's a spider, you're never gonna find it till it lays eggs and the babies spill out."
Nancy,"What's wrong with you? Robin, seriously."
Steve,"She's got problems."
Nancy,"Tell me about it."
Steve,"It's cool you two are friends now. Maybe after we find Vecna, kill him, save the world and stuff, maybe we can all go out. You know? Me, you, Robin, Jonathan, when he's back."
Nancy,"It's not like we're dating. Me and Robin. Not like we're dating. She told you? That we're not?"
Steve,"Yes. She made that very clear. Platonic with a capital P."
Nancy,"Yep. Thank you."
Steve,"I mean… I would date her. It's just… She's… We're just… Never mind. We're friends. Just friends."
Nancy,"Right. Right. Okay. All better."
Steve,"Great. Thanks. Well… Great. Um… Guess we should, uh, get back to the investigation. 'The obvious things are not what people observe.' Or… 'Do… Don't observe.' Or… Sherlock Holmes."
Max,"I wish we had a longer loop."
Lucas,"Forty-six minutes isn't bad."
Max,"I think there are bigger concerns. Like… What if, by listening to this over and over, I get sick of it, and suddenly it's not my favorite anymore? Will it still work? Or will Kate Bush, like, lose her magic power or something?"
Lucas,"Kate Bush? Never."
Max,"You're a Kate Bush fan?"
Lucas,"Uh, yeah. Now I am. Really? Yeah, mega-fan. She… She saved your life. Besides, we're hot on this creep's trail. We're gonna find Vecna and kill him before he even thinks about messing with you again. All right? In fact, I bet if we hit these suckers in the right combo, we might just open a door to his secret lair. Voilà."
Max,"You're such a dork. I thought you were, like, one of the cool kids now."
Lucas,"I'm not cool?"
Max,"I've really missed that."
Lucas,"Missed what?"
Max,"Your laugh."
Lucas,"All done. Work your magic, Kate."
Max,"I promise I'm gonna stop asking this, but… you're seeing that, right?"
Lucas,"Yeah."
Max,"Look."
Brenner,"Stop. Very good, Two. Very good. Now, which brave soul would like to follow that? Hmm? Hmm?"
children,"Me. Me. Me. Me. Me. Me."
Brenner,"Eleven?"
Two,"Why does he waste so much time with her?"
orderly,"Hey. Quiet."
Two,"They're laughing. At you. They think you're weak."
Brenner,"Show them, Eleven. Show them."
Two,"Waste of time."
woman,"What is happening? She's going into arrest."
Brenner,"Okay, that's enough. Pull her out. Pull her out!"
Yuri,"Naughty, naughty bird. Did you fall out of your nest? Where do you think you are going? Come on. Be a good girl now and get back to your place."
Joyce,"Or what? Are you gonna shoot me?"
Yuri,"I… I don't think the KGB would like that. You're right, I cannot kill you. But KGB didn't specify condition you must arrive in. You are fragile cargo. You can still break."
Murray,"Not if I break you first. My fingers are like arrows. My arms, like iron. My feet, like spears. Resist, and I will end you. But turn this plane around, and I will spare your life."
Yuri,"Kiai!"
Murray,"Kiai! My fingers are like arrows. My arms, like iron! My feet, like spears! Kiai! Kiai!"
Joyce,"What did you do?"
Murray,"What?"
Joyce,"I said, 'Don't knock him out.' I thought you didn't know how to fly!"
Murray,"I don't!"
Joyce,"Pull up! Pull up!"
Murray,"I am pulling up!"
Max,"It's like the Christmas lights."
Lucas,"The Christmas lights? Yeah, when Will was in the Upside Down, the lights… came to life."
Max,"Vecna's here. In this house."
Lucas,"Just on the other side. I think he just left the room."
Max,"Did he hear us?"
Lucas,"Can he see us?"
Max,"Headphones."
Lucas,"Wait, wait. Everyone, turn off your flashlights and spread out."
Steve,"We're not gonna be able to see if we turn off our flash… lights."
Dustin,"Jesus Christ."
Robin,"I got him! Got him! I… I had him."
Steve,"Oh, whoa. Oh, I think he's moving. He's moving. He's moving."
Robin,"Shit. I lost him."
Nancy,"No, you didn't."
Steve,"It's an attic. Of course it's an attic."
Dustin,"Hold up, guys. What if he's leading us into a trap? Guys, guys. Shit. Shit, shit, shit, shit."
Eddie,"Dude, he's not here, seriously."
Jason,"Shut up and keep looking."
Eddie,"Dustin? Please. Are… Are you there? Never mind."
Vecna,"Come with me."
Jason,"Holy shit. Hey, freak! Where do you think you're going? Shit. Come on! You scared of some water? Let's go!"
Eddie,"Just come on… you piece of shit! Come on. Gotta help me out here, man. Come on. Come on, you piece of shit! Come on! Goddamn it! Nope? Okay. All right. Okay. Shit. Shit."
Jason,"Hey, stay back, man! Stay back! Come on. We almost have him."
Jason,"Hey, Patrick. Patrick! Patrick! Patrick! Hey, Patrick. Hey, Patrick. Patrick!"
Eleven,"Air."
agent,"Get her some air, for Christ's sake."
Brenner,"It's okay. It will take time to adjust. But you're safe now, hmm?"
Eleven,"No! No! No!"
agent,"Giving us quite the workout. You really wanna do this again?"
Eleven,"Stay away. I said, stay away!"
Brenner,"You didn't think it would be that easy, did you?"
Eleven,"I don't understand."
Brenner,"I do."
Eleven,"Papa?"
Brenner,"Daughter."
