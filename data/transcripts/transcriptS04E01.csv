Brenner,"That's your favorite, isn't it? How are you feeling today? Are you up for some more lessons? Afternoon, Dr. Ellis. Okay. What do you see? Don't force it. Let it come to you. Just like we practiced. Very good. Very good. All right. Now, let's see… Okay. Now what do you see? It’s supposed to be a dog. It does, doesn’t it? I never was much of an artist. All right. Let’s try something a little bit more challenging. Is that all right with you? I want you to find Dr. Ellis. Can you do that? Have you found her? What’s she doing? What kind of lessons? Can you hear what they’re saying? If you’ve lost the visual, just let it go. Try to reorient. They’re screaming. Why are they screaming? Ten? Peter, Alec, what’s going on out there? What have you done? What have you done?"
Ten,"Okay. It’s… a yellow circle. The sun."
Ten,"A… Cow? It looks like a cow."
Ten,"Yes."
Ten,"Lessons with Six in his room."
Ten,"Six is trying to move a block. A red block."
Ten,"Something’s wrong."
Ten,"They’re screaming."
Ten,"Six and Dr. Ellis… Dead. They’re both dead."
Ellis,"Afternoon, Dr. Brenner."
man,"Sir, we’ve got a situation."
Eleven,"Dear Mike, Today is day 185. Feels more like ten years. Joyce says time is funny like that. Emotions can make it speed up or slow down. We are all time travelers if you think about it. For example, this week is going very fast. I think because I am so busy. I have to make something called a visual aid. I hope Mrs. Gracey will give me an A. Some exciting news. Joyce got an amazing new job. She gets to work at home. She says she loves the 'freedom.' Will is painting a lot, but he… he won’t show me what he’s working on. Maybe it is for a girl. I think there is someone he likes, because he has been acting weird. Jonathan is acting weird also. I think he is just nervous about college. He is still waiting for his big letter. I hope he and Nancy get to go together. But I don’t know how he’ll get to college because his car is still broken. His funny friend Argyle has been taking us to school. His hair is longer than mine. And he and Jonathan like to smoke smelly plants together. Jonathan says the plants are super safe because they come from the earth, but to not tell Joyce. Me? I am twice as happy now. You were right. It just takes time. I think I have finally adapted. At first, I missed all the spring flowers, but now I find it pretty here too. I even like school now. I am still best at math, but my grammar is getting good now also. It helps that everyone is so nice here. I have made lots of friends. Even so, I am ready for spring break, mostly because I get to see you. I am so excited to see you, it is hard to breathe. Are you excited too? I think you will love it here like me. I think we will have the best spring break ever. I hope my spelling was better this time. Miss you. Love, El."
Argyle,"All right. Hold on to your butts, brochachos."
Joyce,"I can send you a previous edition as a loaner to see if you like the product before committing to purchasing it…"
Jonathan,"Yeah, I’m… I’m not a robot. You do realize that, don’t you? Prick."
Argyle,"Slow down!"
Mike,"The hell are you doing? It’s ten after. Oh, shit. Shit!"
Nancy,"Thirty seconds or I’m leaving without you, okay? Thirty seconds."
Mike,"Okay, I have to find my pants."
Karen,"Michael, I know your D&D club is tonight. Hellfire."
Ted,"Why don’t you call it the High School Dropout Club?"
Karen,"I want you home no later than 9:00."
Mike,"I’ll try."
Karen,"No trying. You need to go to bed early. Why? It’s a 6:30 flight, Michael."
Mike,"Yeah, I know, but..."
Karen,"No buts. Nine or no California. And no sweetie pie."
Nancy,"Mike! Let’s go."
Mike,"Jesus. How am I gonna survive a whole week without you guys?"
Karen,"Nine."
Ted,"Remind me, when do they become reasonable human beings again?"
Suzie,"That’s a negative, Dustybun."
Dustin,"Son of a bitch. Try 'Tigers86.' 'Tigers86.' Copy that. Jiminy crickets, Dusty. I’m in. Holy shit."
Mom,"What’s going on in there? You’re gonna be late."
Dustin,"Don’t come in! I’m naked!"
Suzie,"Just hold your horsies, Dustybun."
Dustin,"Do you see it?"
Suzie,"Yeah, I see it. Yikes, Dusty. I will repent later."
Dustin,"Yeah."
Steve,"Then there’s Heidi tomorrow night, but the problem with Heidi is that she’s going out of state for college. Do I wanna start another relationship that has no point other than sex? I mean, I don’t know. Does that make sense to you?"
Steve,"Robin, are you listening?"
Robin,"Uh, yes."
Steve,"What did I just say?"
Robin,"Something about sex with Linda."
Steve,"No, I’m talking about Heidi."
Robin,"Cut me some slack, please."
Steve,"Well..."
Robin,"Your love life is one of labyrinthine complexity. It is 7:00 in the morning, we have the stupid pep rally, and I woke up looking like a corpse."
Steve,"You’re worried about a pep rally? Expect me to believe that?"
Robin,"Yeah? So?"
Steve,"So we both know what this is about. Not buying that. This is about Vickie."
Robin,"Absolutely not."
Steve,"It is. You know what else?"
Robin,"I don’t care..."
Steve,"You gotta stop pretending to be someone else when you’re around her. You just gotta be yourself."
Robin,"You’re literally quoting me to me. You do realize that."
Steve,"Maybe you need to listen to yourself. Ever think about that?"
Robin,"I listened. Look at me. Boom. Back in business."
Steve,"It’s not the same thing. Okay?"
Robin,"Well…"
Steve,"You ask out a girl and she says no. Big deal. Nothing happens. Maybe your ego’s a little bruised. I ask out the wrong girl, and bam, I’m a town pariah."
Robin,"I’d buy that, except Vickie is definitely not the firsthand girl."
Steve,"We just don’t know that, do we?"
Robin,"She returned Fast Times paused at 53 minutes, 5 seconds. Know who pauses Fast Times at 53 minutes, 5 seconds? People who like boobies, Robin."
Steve,"Ew! Gross. Don’t say boobies."
Robin,"Boobies."
Steve,"Not a big deal, okay? I like boobies. You like boobies. Vickie likes boobies. Definitely."
Robin,"It’s boobies."
teacher,"To the gym, everyone. Pep rally! Pep rally! Kyle, good to see you. Hey, Josh. To the gym, everyone. To the gym. Go support your Tigers! Go, Tigers! To the gym! Hi, Amber."
MsKelly,"Max! Max! Where were you yesterday?"
Max,"Oh, yeah. Sorry, I forgot it was Thursday."
MsKelly,"I’d like to see you today. Come straight after lunch, okay?"
Dustin,"Look, I’m not saying that my girlfriend is better than yours. It’s just that Suzie’s, like, a certified genius."
Mike,"You do realize El saved the world twice, right?"
Dustin,"And yet you still have a C in Spanish."
announcer,"And let’s hear it for your Tigers!"
player,"Good morning, Hawkins High! First off… Hey. First off, I’d like to thank each and every one of you. Without your support, we wouldn’t be here. Give yourselves a big hand. And of course, of course, I have to give a special shout-out to the best and the prettiest fans of all time, the Tiger Cheer Squad. Chrissy… Chrissy, I love you, babe. You know… I think I can speak for all of us when I say it’s been a tough year for Hawkins. So much loss. And sometimes I wonder, 'How much loss can one community take?' In dark days like this, we need something to believe in. So, last night, when we were down by ten points at half to Christian Academy, I looked at my team, and I said, 'Think of Jack. Think of Melissa. Think of Heather. Think of Billy. Think about our heroic police chief, Jim Hopper. Think about every one of our friends who perished in that fire. What did they die for? For us to lose to some… some crap school?' 'No.' 'For us to return home with our heads hung low in defeat?' 'No!' 'No.' 'Let’s win this game. Let’s win this game for them.' And that’s exactly what we did! We embarrassed those candy-asses in their own house, and now tonight, tonight, we’re gonna bring home the championship trophy! Let’s go!"
Mike,"Tonight?"
Max,"They call it a tournament. You win one game, you go on until there’s only one team left."
Dustin,"I don’t get the big deal. Just talk to Eddie. Get him to move Hellfire to another night."
Mike,"'Just talk to Eddie.' Why don’t you just talk to your coach and get him to move the game?"
Dustin,"I think that’s a great idea, Mike. Thank you, Dustin."
Mike,"This is the championship game."
Dustin,"And this is the end of Eddie’s campaign. A semester of adventuring has led to this moment, and we need you."
Mike,"Yeah, and the Tigers don’t. You’ve been on the bench all year."
Dustin,"That’s not the point. Please, arrive at the point."
Mike,"If I get in good with these guys, I’ll be in the popular crowd, and then you guys will be too."
Dustin,"Has it ever occurred to you that we don’t want to be popular?"
Mike,"You wanna be stuck with the nerds and freaks for three more years?"
Dustin,"We are nerds and freaks."
Mike,"But maybe we don’t have to be. Look, I’m tired of being bullied. I’m tired of girls laughing at us. I’m tired of feeling like a loser. We came to high school wanting things to be different. Right? So now we have that chance. I skip tonight, that’s all out the window. So I’m asking you guys, as a friend, just talk to Eddie. Get him to move Hellfire. Come to my game. Please."
Joyce,"Mrs. Ergenbright, let me ask you something. Have you ever wished you could have the answer to any question, right at your fingertips?"
MrsErgenbright,"Oh, gosh."
Joyce,"Yeah, just imagine, you’d never have to go to the library again. Or, hey, think of the money that you’ll save on gas alone."
MrsErgenbright,"Oh, good point."
Jonathan,"Anything?"
Joyce,"Nothing."
Jonathan,"Acceptance letters tend to come end of week to make you sweat."
Joyce,"Well, I’m sweating."
Mailman,"It’s coming, Mrs. Byers. Don’t you worry."
Joyce,"I always worry. Thanks."
MrsErgenbright,"Oh, gosh. Did I lose you? Hello?"
Joyce,"No, sorry. Carol? Can I call you Carol?"
MrsErgenbright,"Of… Of course."
Joyce,"Great. So, what are we thinking? Could do volumes A through C, or we could do the… the whole alphabet."
MrsErgenbright,"Well, uh, remind me how much money… I can’t remember..."
Joyce,"Carol, uh, can I call you back?"
MrsErgenbright,"Oh, sure."
girl,"After learning to speak, she traveled the world to spread her message, and along the way, changed how the world perceived those like her with disabilities. And that is why I have chosen Helen Keller as my hero."
teacher,"That was wonderful, Angela. Truly wonderful. What an inspiring story."
Angela,"Thank you."
teacher,"Okay. Now let’s see who has to follow that. Jane."
Eleven,"Hi. For my hero, I… I chose my dad. And for my visual aid, I made a 'direyama' of our cabin."
student,"More like diarrhea."
teacher,"Quiet, everyone. Let’s be respectful."
Eleven,"This is my dad. His name is Hopper. He made the best Eggos, and… we liked to watch Miami Vice on Fridays. This is Mr. Fibbly. He is a squirrel."
student,"What?"
Eleven,"And this is the alarm that my dad made. I… I was never scared because… Beca... because…"
Eddie,"Do you ever feel like you’re losing your mind?"
Chrissy,"Um, you know, just… on a daily basis."
Eddie,"I feel like I’m losing my mind right now doing a drug deal with Chrissy Cunningham, the queen of Hawkins High. You know, this isn’t the first time that we’ve, um… Hung out."
Chrissy,"No?"
Eddie,"You don’t remember? That’s okay. I wouldn’t remember me either, Chrissy."
Chrissy,"Honestly, do I have stuff in my hair?"
Eddie,"You don’t remember me?"
Chrissy,"I’m sorry."
Eddie,"Middle school, talent show. You were doing this cheer thing. You know, the… the thing you do. It was pretty cool, actually. And I… I was with my band."
Chrissy,"Corroded Coffin. Oh my God! Yes, of course."
Eddie,"With a name like that, how could I forget?"
Chrissy,"I dunno. You’re a freak."
Eddie,"No, you just… You looked so..."
Chrissy,"Different?"
Eddie,"Yeah. Well, uh, my hair was buzzed, and I didn’t have these sweet old tatties yet."
Chrissy,"You played guitar, right?"
Eddie,"Uh-huh. Still do. Still do. You should come see us. Uh, we play at The Hideout on Tuesdays. It’s pretty cool. We… We actually get a crowd of about five drunks. It’s not exactly the Garden, but you gotta start somewhere, right? So…"
Chrissy,"You know, you’re not what I thought you’d be like."
Eddie,"Mean and scary?"
Chrissy,"Yeah."
Eddie,"Yeah, well, I actually kinda thought you’d be kinda mean and scary too."
Chrissy,"Me?"
Eddie,"Terrifying. Uh, so, in other good news, flattery works with me, so… Twenty-five percent discount for the half. Fifteen bucks. You’re robbing me blind here, you know."
Chrissy,"Do you have anything maybe stronger?"
teacher,"Nice job, Kate."
teacher,"Excellent work, Paul. Nice improvement."
teacher,"Very disappointing, Jane. Let’s talk after break."
Angela,"Oh my God. I am so sorry. I hope Mr. Fibbly’s okay."
boy,"Whoops!"
Angela,"Oh my God."
Eleven,"Angela!"
MrsGracey,"Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! What’s going on here? What’s going on? Jane? Jane. Did someone do this?"
Eleven,"I tripped. It was just an accident."
MrsGracey,"All right, Angela. You come with me."
Angela,"What? Why? I didn’t do anything. Tell her, Jane. Tell her!"
Will,"Shit. El. El. Shit. El… I’m sorry. It’s gonna be okay. It… It’s not that bad. We’ll fix it together, okay? Okay? Shit."
Murray,"Was this really necessary?"
Joyce,"If that porcelain belly is pregnant with an explosive device, you will soon be thanking me."
Murray,"And remember, you are not lowering this bucket. You are… Releasing it. Got it."
Joyce,"We want to make sure that we destroy that doll with as much force as possible. Yep. Got it."
Murray,"One more thing. Joyce. Are you there? Talk to me! Joyce! Joyce! Joyce! Joyce! Joyce!"
Joyce,"Yeah?"
Murray,"What happened?"
Joyce,"It broke."
Murray,"Do you see a bug? Anything with wires? Or anything that… that doesn’t look like the insides of a doll. Anything like that? Joyce! Joyce! Where’d you go? Where’d you go now? Why are you not answering me again? Joyce!"
child,"Mommy, what’s she doing?"
announcer,"Everyone now please rise for our national anthem. Singing for us tonight, we have a very special guest. All the way from Nashville, our very own Tammy Thompson!"
student1,"Go, Tammy!"
student2,"We love you, Tammy!"
Tammy,"O say, can you see, by the dawn’s early light…"
Steve,"Told you. Muppet."
Robin,"Okay, she does sound like a Muppet. Oh my God, totally."
Steve,"She sounds like Kermit."
Robin,"I was thinking it was more like Miss Piggy."
Steve,"I used to think she sounded good 'cause I had this massive crush..."
Robin,"Sorry?"
Steve,"Um, we… we took a… a massively hard class together. We were… We were in Mrs. Click’s class together."
Robin,"Yeah."
Steve,"Uh… Sorry, were you asking me a question?"
Robin,"No."
Steve,"Oh, okay."
Robin,"Wow. She sounds amazing, doesn’t she?"
Eddie,"Absolutely not."
Dustin,"You asked for a sub. We delivered."
Eddie,"This is Hellfire Club. Not Babysitting Club."
Erica,"I’m 11, you long-haired freak."
Eddie,"My, my, the child speaks. So, what’s your name, child?"
Erica,"Erica Sinclair."
Eddie,"So this is Sinclair’s infamous sister."
Dustin,"He’s sharp."
Eddie,"What’s your class and level? Level one dwarf?"
Erica,"My name is Lady Applejack. And I’m a chaotic good half-elf rogue, level 14. I will sneak behind any monster you throw my way and stab them in the back with my poison-soaked kukri. And I’ll smile as I watch them die a slow, agonizing death. So, we gonna do this, or we gonna keep chitchatting like this is your mommy’s book club?"
Eddie,"Welcome to Hellfire."
cheerleaders,"Push 'em back, defense! Push 'em back…"
coach,"Hey! Yo, you gotta stay on 'em. Stay on 'em! Let’s go! Go!"
Nancy,"Looks like my headline has a shot."
Eddie,"The hooded cultists chant, 'Hail Lord Vecna.' 'Hail Lord Vecna.' They turn to you, remove their hoods. You recognize most of them from Makbar. But there is one you do not recognize, his skin shriveled, desiccated. And something else. He is not only missing his left arm, but his left eye!"
Dustin,"No! No!"
Mike,"Vecna’s dead."
Dustin,"He was killed by Kas."
Eddie,"So it was thought, my friends. So it was thought. But Vecna lives."
player,"Yo, what the hell was that? What the hell was that? That’s not me, that’s him."
Eddie,"You are scared. You’re tired. You are injured. Do you flee Vecna and his cultists? Or stand your ground and fight?"
Dustin,"Come on."
coach,"Sinclair, you’re in. Huh? You’re in. Son, let’s go!"
Dustin,"I say we fight. To the death."
Mike,"To the death."
Erica,"To the death."
Eddie,"Guys, I hate to say this, but we’ve got to flee."
Gareth,"I concur."
Dustin,"Didn’t we just agree 'to the death'?"
Gareth,"That wasn’t literal."
Mike,"Vecna just decimated us. We can’t kill him with two players."
Dustin,"You too? He only has 15 hit points left. Don’t be pussies."
Gareth,"Pussies? Really? 'Cause we’re not delusional?"
Mike,"Delusional? How about not cowards?"
Eddie,"Hey! If I may interject, gentlemen, Lady Applejack. Whilst I respect the passion, you’d be wise to take Gareth the Great’s concern to heart. There is no shame in running. Don’t try to be heroes. Not today, 'kay?"
Dustin,"One sec. What do you think?"
Eddie,"How many hit points do you and Applejack have left?"
Dustin,"Twelve."
Erica,"Twelve."
coach,"Here, on inbound, they’re gonna try and take away Jason and double-team him. That is gonna free up Patrick."
Lucas,"Wait, no. You gotta let me take the shot."
coach,"It’s risky as hell."
Eddie,"But you’re the ones on the battlefield. So it’s your call."
Dustin,"What do you say, Lady Applejack?"
Erica,"You really gotta ask?"
Dustin,"Screw it."
Eddie,"Let’s kill the son of a bitch."
Lucas,"Winners find a way to win. Let me find a way."
Eddie,"The chances of success are 20-to-1."
Lucas,"Never tell me the odds. Just get me the ball. Get me the ball."
Eddie,"Give me the D20."
Dustin,"Please! Come on!"
Erica,"Please! Come on!"
Lucas,"Please! Come on!"
Eddie,"That’s a miss!"
Dustin,"No! Shit! Shit!"
Eddie,"Crit hit!"
Dustin,"What? What? Yes! Yes!"
player,"That’s you, baby! That’s you!"
Jason,"Yeah, man."
player,"Hey, Jed, you comin’?"
Jason,"Oh, yeah. Party at Benny’s, boys!"
man1,"After a tragic year for our town, the Tigers have brought home the conference title for the first time in 22 years."
man2,"And what a great game it was, Allen, ending with a dramatic buzzer-beater from bench warmer Lucas Sinclair. He must be feeling on top of the world right..."
Max,"All right, all right, I hear you."
woman,"It’ll be 3.07."
man,"Yeah. But this is your old friend Billy talking. You know, just… just a little favor. And I don’t think..."
woman,"No. I don’t wanna do that stuff. Not for you, not for anybody. I’m trying to be normal, Billy."
Max,"I’m coming. I’m coming. Here you go. Good boy."
Eddie,"This is, uh, my castle."
Max,"Okay. All right. One more. That’s it though, right? Good boy."
Eddie,"Sorry for the mess. Uh, the maid took the week off."
Chrissy,"You, um… You live here alone?"
Eddie,"With my uncle. But, uh, he works nights at the plant. Bringing home the big bucks."
Chrissy,"How long does it take?"
Eddie,"Sorry?"
Chrissy,"The Special K. How long to kick in?"
Eddie,"Oh, uh, well, it depends if you snort it or not. Uh, if you do, then, uh, yeah. It’ll, uh, kick in pretty quick."
Chrissy,"Oh, shit."
Eddie,"You’re sure you have it? No, no, I got it. Um, somewhere."
Eddie,"Sorry I’m late, sweetheart. You’re beautiful."
Chrissy,"Eddie? Did you find it? Eddie? Eddie? Eddie?"
Chrissy,"Mom?"
ChrissyMom,"Just loosening this up for you, sweetheart. You’re going to look… absolutely beautiful."
Chrissy,"No! No!"
ChrissyMom,"Chrissy! Chrissy, open the door!"
Chrissy,"No!"
Eddie,"Gotcha. Found it. Peaceful bliss, just moments away."
Eddie,"Chrissy? Chrissy. Hello? Chrissy. Hey, Chrissy, wake up. Hey. Hello? Chrissy. Hello? Hey, Chrissy. Chrissy. Chrissy, wake up now! Chrissy! I don’t like this, Chrissy! Wake up! Chrissy! Chrissy! Chrissy!"
creature,"Chrissy? Chrissy. Don’t cry, Chrissy. It’s time for your suffering… To end."
Eddie,"What… Jesus Christ!"
Chrissy,"Dad. Dad! Dad? No! Help! Help! Somebody, help me!"
