Murray, "It's perfect."
Murray, "Somewhere like…"
Antonov, "Yeah."
Murray, "I can totally see it. You in Indiana."
Antonov, "Indiana?"
Murray, "Yeah."
Murray, "Well, you have a certain stoic... More Clint Eastwood than..."
Yuri, "Good news, my friends."
Yuri, "Katinka feeling better."
Yuri, "Shall we give her another try?"
Murray, "Why not?"
Murray, "Asshole."
Antonov, "This guy."
Yuri, "Yuri!"
Murray, "That's enough."
Murray, "That's enough! Hey!"
Murray, "The hell you think you're doing?"
Yuri, "Get your hands off me, potato head."
Murray, "You're trying to break her, aren't ya?"
Murray, "Get us captured again so you can get your reward? That it?"
Yuri, "What do you two lizard brains know?"
Yuri, "You're engineers now?"
Murray, "I know that sound is not good."
Yuri, "On contrary, those noises you hear,"
Yuri, "that… it's very good sign."
Murray, "Good sign, huh?"
Yuri, "Yeah."
Yuri, "My women make noise when I please them."
Yuri, "You don't know what that is like. I understand."
Yuri, "But for those like me who knows what and where to touch,"
Yuri, "much noise."
Joyce, "Yeah."
Joyce, "These are the smallest I could find."
Joyce, "That's it for shirts."
Joyce, "Oh. Well…"
Joyce, "Cute."
Hopper, "Yuri has good taste. What can I say?"
Joyce, "Um…"
Joyce, "Oh, sorry."
Hopper, "Sorry."
Joyce, "I'll go over here."
Hopper, "Okay."
Joyce, "What did they do to you?"
Joyce, "Oh my God."
Hopper, "No, it's not that bad. It's…"
Hopper, "You know, I needed to lose weight anyway."
Hopper, "It's given me time to think, you know?"
Hopper, "About who I've been and…"
Hopper, "And what I've done."
Hopper, "I never should've sent you that message."
Joyce, "You didn't know what was gonna happen."
Hopper, "I knew it'd be dangerous."
Joyce, "So did I."
Joyce, "I made this choice."
Joyce, "And I would choose it again, even knowing everything that I know."
Joyce, "I would."
Joyce, "Plus, you know, we do have that date to get to."
Hopper, "Remember?"
Joyce, "'Remember'?"
Joyce, "I've been dreaming about it."
Hopper, "Oh, yeah?"
Hopper, "Yeah."
Hopper, "I have it all planned out."
Joyce, "Pray tell."
Hopper, "I'm getting two orders of bread sticks. Two."
Hopper, "Those things knock your socks off."
Hopper, "Enzo puts some spice on 'em."
Hopper, "I don't know what it is, but it's good."
Hopper, "And you dip it in olive oil? Forget about it."
Hopper, "And, uh, I'm wavering on the main course between the veal and the lasagne."
Hopper, "But I think I gotta go with lasagne, right?"
Joyce, "So, you… you've been dreaming about bread sticks and lasagne?"
Hopper, "I've been on a diet of watery soup, moldy bread, and maggots,"
Hopper, "so, yeah, I've been dreaming about bread sticks and lasagne."
Hopper, "I mean, sue me."
Hopper, "Should I have been dreaming about something else?"
Joyce, "You tell me."
Hopper, "Well,"
Hopper, "there's wine."
Joyce, "Oh, well, wine's good."
Hopper, "I was thinking about a nice 'Cheeanti.'"
Joyce, "Chianti."
Hopper, "Chianti, right."
Hopper, "Then there's dessert."
Joyce, "You gotta have dessert."
Hopper, "Gotta have dessert."
Joyce, "And after that?"
Hopper, "I don't know."
Joyce, "Use your imagination."
Hopper, "Who needs imagination?"
Hopper, "Damn it!"
Joyce, "Remember, they're listening!"
Nancy, "Okay. I wanna run through it one more time."
Nancy, "Phase one."
Steve, "We meet Erica at the playground."
Steve, "She'll signal Max and Lucas when we're ready."
Nancy, "Phase two."
Steve, "Max baits Vecna."
Steve, "He'll go after her, which'll put him in his trance."
Nancy, "Phase three?"
Dustin, "Me and Eddie draw the bats away."
Nancy, "Four."
Robin, "We head into Vecna's newly bat-free lair, and…"
Robin, "…flambé."
Nancy, "Nobody moves on to the next phase until we've all copied."
Nancy, "Nobody deviates from the plan, no matter what."
Nancy, "Got it?"
All, "Got it."
Dustin, "Be careful."
Steve, "Thanks, buddy."
Steve, "Here goes nothing."
Eddie, "What does he want us to do, applaud?"
Steve, "All right."
Steve, "Let's go."
Steve, "Gotcha."
Steve, "Hey, guys, listen."
Steve, "If things here start to go south, I mean, at all,"
Steve, "you abort."
Steve, "Okay? Draw the attention of the bats."
Steve, "Keep 'em busy for a minute or two. We'll take care of Vecna."
Steve, "Don't try to be cute or be a hero or something."
Steve, "Okay? You guys are just..."
Steve, "Decoys."
Dustin, "Decoys."
Dustin, "Don't worry. You can be the hero, Steve."
Eddie, "Absolutely. I mean,"
Eddie, "look at us."
Eddie, "We are not heroes."
Dustin, "Hey, Steve?"
Dustin, "Make him pay."
Jonathan, "No, no. Like I said, I… I've tried everyone."
Jonathan, "Yeah, TWA, Pan Am, Eastern."
Jonathan, "No, it doesn't have to be a one-way."
Jonathan, "I'll take one seat, if you have it."
Jonathan, "I mean, please, there has to be something that you can do."
Jonathan, "One of our family members is really, really sick,"
Jonathan, "and I don't know if she's gonna make it through the night."
Jonathan, "Is there any way that you could just…"
Jonathan, "No. No. No."
Jonathan, "Like I said before, I… I've tried them already."
Jonathan, "Okay, well, is there any way that I could speak to a manager?"
Jonathan, "There… There's no one there?"
Jonathan, "No, that's the problem. I can't call back."
Terry, "Breathe. Sunflower."
Terry, "Rainbow. Three to the right. Four to the…"
Terry, "Three."
Terry, "Rainbow."
Mike, "Damn it."
Will, "What'd they say?"
Mike, "Earliest is tomorrow."
Will, "No. That's way too late."
Mike, "Shit."
Mike, "I know."
Argyle, "Hey, dudes?"
Argyle, "Ask 'em if we can ride in the baggage compartment."
Jonathan, "The baggage compartment?"
Mike, "We'd suffocate."
Argyle, "Dogs ride in there all the time, man."
Argyle, "They don't suffocate."
Mike, "Jesus Christ."
Will, "Holy shit."
Eleven, "I have a way."
Eleven, "A way to protect Max."
Eleven, "From here."
Eleven, "This is Max."
Eleven, "When One attacks, he'll be in her mind."
Eleven, "But I can do that too."
Eleven, "I went into Mama's mind, into Billy's."
Eleven, "I can go into Max's."
Eleven, "She can carry me to Vecna."
Eleven, "I can piggyback."
Eleven, "I can protect her."
Eleven, "From One."
Eleven, "Fight him from here."
Argyle, "Mind fight. Righteous."
Will, "Wait, so you actually think this can work?"
Eleven, "A bathtub would help."
Argyle, "Yeah. Gotta be clean to enter the mind."
Mike, "What? No, no. It's a sensory deprivation tank."
Mike, "It helps her calm down and focus on her powers."
Jonathan, "Wait, we… we just passed a motel."
Mike, "Yeah, but they won't have enough salt."
Argyle, "Well, how much salt are we talking here, my dudes?"
Mike, "Well, depends on the size of the tub, but a lot."
Jonathan, "Does 600 pounds suffice?"
Mike, "You know a place that has 600 pounds of salt?"
Argyle, "Let's see…"
Argyle, "Yep."
Argyle, "Yep. It'll work."
Mike, "What will work?"
Argyle, "I know a magical place that has all you need,"
Argyle, "my brave, little super powered friend."
Argyle, "That mind fight is on."
Argyle, "Come on."
Argyle, "¡Vámonos! Let's go! Pronto!"
Max, "Holy shit. This is insane."
Max, "Against the rules?"
Max, "We make our own rules."
Sullivan, "Hey!"
Sullivan, "I think we got something."
Agent, "Send Ryan."
Sullivan, "I don't wanna waste any more time with bullshit leads."
Agent, "I don't think you'll wanna send Ryan on this one."
Sullivan, "You know the murder house on Morehead?"
Agent, "Yeah."
Sullivan, "What about it?"
Hopper, "Okay, and, uh, who exactly was this mystery woman?"
Murray, "Not sure."
Murray, "I mean, she wasn't exactly Miss Talkative."
Murray, "You know? I spent five minutes trying to convince her I was real."
Murray, "I'm supposed to be dead, remember?"
Murray, "Anyway, I finally get around to half-convincing her,"
Murray, "she starts to open up a little, then says that she's…"
Murray, "A friend of the doc's."
Hopper, "Great, so am I. Now put me on the phone with him."
Murray, "I'm afraid the doc is indisposed."
Hopper, "Indisposed?"
Murray, "It gets worse."
Murray, "She said the doc's with the girl."
Murray, "And the girl went off to fight some evil in Hawkins."
Murray, "Then they all went off-grid. The doc, the girl, everybody."
Hopper, "'The girl,' meaning… El."
Murray, "Yeah, it has to be."
Hopper, "This is your daughter, American?"
Murray, "Mm-hmm."
Murray, "And they're not alone."
Murray, "Joyce's kids are with 'em."
Hopper, "Okay, I… I see the mood here is bleak."
Hopper, "And understandably so."
Hopper, "But I do think we need to consider"
Hopper, "the very real possibility"
Hopper, "that this mystery woman is, in fact, KGB."
Hopper, "And she's..."
Joyce, "No."
Joyce, "She's telling the truth."
Joyce, "When we were in the lab, those particles we saw,"
Joyce, "they were alive."
Joyce, "And if they're alive, that means a gate's open in Hawkins."
Antonov, "'Gate'? What does this mean?"
Joyce, "It means we have to go home right now."
Joyce, "What is taking so long?"
Hopper, "I thought you said he was close."
Joyce, "Yeah, close to sabotaging us, you mean."
Murray, "We think he's playing us again."
Joyce, "So put a goddamn gun to his head."
Murray, "And then what? He just spits out more lies."
Murray, "It's moot anyway."
Murray, "If your kids are truly in some kind of imminent danger,"
Murray, "even if we were to leave this very moment, we wouldn't make it in time."
Murray, "The earliest we'd get there is late tomorrow."
Joyce, "No, we… we don't have to make it back."
Joyce, "Not tonight."
Joyce, "Whatever this evil is,"
Joyce, "we know it's connected to the hive mind."
Joyce, "And now we know part of that hive mind is in Russia."
Joyce, "So we don't need to get back to Hawkins to fight it."
Joyce, "All we need is to destroy those particles."
Joyce, "And if we're lucky,"
Joyce, "it'll hurt it enough to give the kids the upper hand."
Murray, "Wait, time out."
Murray, "We're talking about the particles inside the prison?"
Murray, "The prison that we just narrowly escaped from?"
Hopper, "We broke out."
Hopper, "We can break back in."
Joyce, "Jim!"
Murray, "The entire Soviet army is looking for us."
Hopper, "Sure. And we'll be exactly where they least expect."
Murray, "All right. There is a fine line between courage and stupidity,"
Murray, "and this falls very far on the side of stupid."
Murray, "This is Dirty Dozen stuff."
Murray, "Except there are, uh, four of us."
Hopper, "Three, actually."
Hopper, "Breaking back in's gonna be easier than breaking out."
Hopper, "Which is why we need an airlift. This is where you come in."
Hopper, "I don't care what it takes."
Hopper, "You get Yuri in line, and you get that bird in the air."
Murray, "On it."
Murray, "Yu… Yuri mentioned something about a flamethrower, right?"
Hopper, "Oh, yeah."
Hopper, "This'll do."
Hopper, "This'll do just fine."
Argyle, "You gotta be shitting me."
Argyle, "Trust me on this one, my dudes."
Argyle, "Surf's up, my dude."
Argyle, "Uh, whoa."
Argyle, "Nice shirt, my dude."
Pizza Guy, "Thanks, my dude."
Argyle, "Uh, listen, I would love to feed a fellow Surfer Boy,"
Argyle, "but kitchen closed, like, five minutes ago,"
Argyle, "so no more pies tonight, man."
Argyle, "That's all right, my dude."
Argyle, "We're not here for your tasty pies."
Argyle, "You see this weird girl behind me?"
Argyle, "She needs a tub with a bunch of salt so we can enhance her psychic power"
Argyle, "so she can save the world from this super bad dude."
Argyle, "But to make this salty tub,"
Argyle, "we require your kitchen."
Pizza Guy, "Ah."
Pizza Guy, "Well, it's just, uh…"
Pizza Guy, "I'm supposed to meet Chaz at Taco Bell"
Pizza Guy, "in, like, ten. So…"
Argyle, "My dude."
Argyle, "We're not asking you to help for free."
Argyle, "You ever partake in…"
Argyle, "Purple Palm Tree Delight?"
Argyle, "It'll make all your troubles float away."
Argyle, "Like the seed pods of a dandelion in the wind."
Argyle, "First-ever mind fight held in a pizza dough freezer."
Argyle, "Pretty rad, right?"
Eddie, "Not bad."
Eddie, "Not bad at all."
Eddie, "Now for the fun part."
Eddie, "Jesus Chr…"
Eddie, "It's like… she was destined for an alternate dimension."
Eddie, "What do you say, Henderson?"
Eddie, "Are you ready for the most metal concert in the history of the world?"
Dustin, "That a rhetorical question?"
Eddie, "Let's do it."
Robin, "Uh… I don't mean to freak anyone out,"
Robin, "but I swear we've seen this tree before."
Nancy, "That's impossible."
Robin, "That would suck, right?"
Robin, "If Vecna destroyed the world because… 'cause we got lost in the woods?"
Nancy, "We're not lost, Robin."
Robin, "Robin, hey. Watch out for the vines! Hive mind."
Robin, "Remember?"
Robin, "Thank you!"
Steve, "Uh, Don't worry about her."
Steve, "She's just stressed."
Steve, "You know, scared."
Nancy, "Yeah. Yeah. I… I know."
Nancy, "It's just…"
Nancy, "She's a super klutz?"
Steve, "She did tell me that it took her longer to walk than most babies, so…"
Nancy, "I really shouldn't laugh."
Nancy, "When I was a baby,"
Nancy, "I actually crawled backwards."
Steve, "Crawled backwards?"
Eleven, "Come on. I know you're in there."
Eleven, "I know you're in there. Wake up."
Eleven, "Wake up."
Eleven, "Wake up."
Eleven, "No."
Eleven, "You're not going."
Eleven, "No."
Eleven, "Hi."
Max, "Hi…?"
Eleven, "Max wanted to have a sleepover."
Max, "Which one?"
Eleven, "This is Wonder Woman."
Eleven, "AKA Princess Diana."
Eleven, "Not Hopper."
Eleven, "Not Mike."
Eleven, "You."
Eleven, "Is this really gonna work?"
Max, "See? What'd I tell you?"
Eleven, "There's more to life than stupid boys."
Reporter, "It's been less than 48 hours since a 7.4 magnitude earthquake"
Reporter, "rocked the quaint town of Hawkins, 80 miles outside of Indianapolis,"
Reporter, "in an event that seismologists are calling"
Reporter, "'a natural disaster of near-unprecedented scale.'"
Reporter, "The death toll now stands at 22."
Reporter, "But with hundreds more filling Roane County hospitals"
Reporter, "and many more still missing,"
Reporter, "officials expect those numbers to rise."
Reporter, "This is only the latest tragedy to befall this once-safe town."
Reporter, "Most recently, a string of high school students were killed"
Reporter, "in a series of ritualistic murders,"
Reporter, "which have been linked to a local satanic cult"
Reporter, "known as 'Hellfire.'"
Reporter, "Eddie Munson, the leader of this cult and prime suspect in the murders,"
Reporter, "has been missing since the earthquake and is presumed dead."
Reporter, "But this offers little comfort to the people of Hawkins,"
Reporter, "who are scared, angry, and searching for answers."
Reporter, "Why their town? What have they done to deserve so much suffering?"
Reporter, "A growing chorus believes the two recent tragedies are linked,"
Reporter, "claiming the Munson murders opened a doorway between worlds."
Reporter, "A doorway, they say, into hell itself."
Volunteer, "Are you hearing this?"
Volunteer, "They're now calling it a doorway into hell."
Volunteer, "Great. More hysteria. Just what we need."
Volunteer, "Well, it's the news."
Volunteer, "Now indistinguishable from the tabloids."
Steve, "Hey, Nance!"
Steve, "I found some more of your old stuff in the attic."
Nancy, "Mr. Rabbit."
Steve, "It's okay if you wanna save him, you know?"
Nancy, "No, he'll be more loved in a new home."
Karen, "Someone order a pizza?"
Mike, "Pizza?"
Mike, "Mom!"
Jonathan, "Hey!"
Karen, "You are never going on vacation again, you hear me?"
Karen, "In fact, you can forget about college."
Karen, "You are staying right here."
Jonathan, "Are you okay?"
Will, "Yeah."
Will, "Yeah, I'm okay."
Will, "But, Jonathan..."
Will, "This isn't an earthquake."
Jonathan, "I know."
Jonathan, "I know a lot more than you think."
Will, "How?"
Jonathan, "We've been trying to call you..."
Jonathan, "I know."
Jonathan, "I know. I'm sorry."
Jonathan, "We just couldn't risk contact."
Will, "'We couldn't risk contact'?"
Jonathan, "Hey, hey, I'll tell you everything, okay?"
Will, "Okay."
Jonathan, "I promise."
Jonathan, "But, for now,"
Jonathan, "I'm just glad you're safe."
Mike, "Where's Lucas?"
Dustin, "He's at the hospital."
Mike, "Was he hurt?"
Dustin, "No. No, he's…"
Dustin, "Oh God."
Dustin, "You don't know."
Lucas, "'He opened his eyes, and further words died in his throat.'"
Lucas, "'He forgot about the need to sick up that horrible parody of wine.'"
Lucas, "'He forgot about his mother,"
Lucas, "and Uncle Morgan, and his father,"
Lucas, "and almost everything else.'"
Lucas, "'Speedy was gone.'"
Lucas, "'The graceful arcs of the roller coaster against the sky were gone.'"
Lucas, "'He could feel the hair stirring on the nape of his neck,"
Lucas, "could feel a goofed-up grin pulling at the corners of his mouth.'"
Lucas, "'Speedy! I'm here, my God!'"
Lucas, "'I'm here in the territories!'"
Lucas, "Oh my God."
Mike, "We've been calling you guys like crazy."
Lucas, "I know."
Mike, "We came as soon as we heard."
Lucas, "I'm sorry."
Mike, "Do they know…"
Mike, "When she will wake?"
Lucas, "No."
Lucas, "They say she might not."
Lucas, "Her heart stopped."
Lucas, "For over a minute."
Lucas, "She died."
Lucas, "I… I mean, clinically, but…"
Lucas, "Then she came back."
Lucas, "The doctors don't know how."
Lucas, "They say it's a miracle."
Eleven, "I'm here, Max."
Nancy, "Hi."
Volunteer, "Hi."
Nancy, "Uh, so these are blankets and sheets."
Nancy, "And some… some clothes and… and some kids' toys."
Volunteer, "Wow. It's already so organized."
Volunteer, "We appreciate that."
Volunteer, "Do you want a tax receipt for it?"
Nancy, "Um…"
Nancy, "No. I don't think that we need one. Thank you, though."
Nancy, "But is there anything else that we can do to help?"
Volunteer, "Okay, then we sort by age."
Volunteer, "We've got infants, girls, boys, men, women…"
Volunteer, "Oh, if anything is in too bad shape, we really don't want that."
Robin, "I found another jar of peanut butter, and it's crunchy…"
Nancy, "Robin."
Robin, "Hi."
Vickie, "What are you doing here?"
Robin, "I am…"
Robin, "I… I am making PB&Js."
Vickie, "Right, yeah. No. Duh. Of course."
Robin, "Uh, I… I am also making PB&Js, as it so happens."
Robin, "Cool."
Robin, "Hey, uh, I… I'm sorry if that came out weird."
Robin, "I didn't mean it like, 'What are you doing here?'"
Robin, "I just meant, 'What are you doing here?' Like, 'Nice surprise. Great to see you.'"
Vickie, "I didn't take it as anything negative."
Robin, "Okay, good. Good."
Vickie, "No, I… I'm sorry. My brain's been a little frazzled lately."
Robin, "'Cause..."
Vickie, "Of everything?"
Robin, "Yeah."
Vickie, "Yeah, and Dan."
Vickie, "Um, he's my boyfriend."
Vickie, "Well, was my boyfriend."
Vickie, "He was visiting, took one look at this,"
Vickie, "and it's not what he was envisioning for spring break."
Vickie, "He was like, 'I'm outta here. Back to Purdue. Good luck.'"
Vickie, "Which, ultimately, it's bordering on a good thing, 'cause he was grating on me."
Vickie, "He is the type who trashes Fast Times 'cause it has no plot."
Vickie, "I should've just ended things right there and then."
Vickie, "Sorry."
Vickie, "I'm so sorry."
Vickie, "I am rambling about my dumb boyfriend when there are people out there suffering."
Vickie, "Who need… food."
Vickie, "And I have just made a peanut butter on peanut butter monstrosity."
Vickie, "I don't know what's wrong with me."
Vickie, "Um, it's like sometimes my mouth is moving faster than my brain,"
Vickie, "and it's like this runaway train,"
Vickie, "and I cannot seem to get it to stop, no matter how hard I try."
Vickie, "You know what I mean?"
Robin, "Uh, yeah, I think I know what you mean."
Robin, "It's a gift."
Vickie, "Oh, for me?"
Robin, "You're welcome. Mm-hmm."
Vickie, "You really shouldn't have."
Robin, "Oh, but I did."
Vickie, "I just don't even deserve it."
Robin, "But I did."
Vickie, "I mean, thank you."
Robin, "Early birthday."
Vickie, "Thank you so much. Oh, oh, wow."
Robin, "H2O?"
Robin, "Vital for all forms of life."
Dustin, "Mr. Munson?"
Dustin, "I'm Dustin Henderson."
Dustin, "Can we talk?"
Mr. Munson, "I can't imagine we got anything to talk about."
Mr. Munson, "My nephew is innocent."
Mr. Munson, "He's still missing."
Mr. Munson, "I'll put up as many posters as I need until he's found."
Mr. Munson, "Good day to you."
Dustin, "I was with him."
Dustin, "I was with him when the earthquake hit."
Mr. Munson, "And… where is Eddie now?"
Dustin, "I'm…"
Dustin, "I'm so sorry."
Dustin, "I wish everyone had gotten to know him."
Dustin, "Really know him."
Dustin, "Because they would've loved him,"
Dustin, "Mr. Munson."
Dustin, "They would've loved him."
Dustin, "Even in the end…"
Dustin, "He never stopped being Eddie."
Dustin, "Despite everything."
Dustin, "I never even saw him get mad."
Dustin, "He could've run."
Dustin, "He could've saved himself."
Dustin, "But he fought."
Dustin, "He fought and died to protect this town."
Dustin, "This town that… hated him."
Dustin, "He isn't just innocent…"
Dustin, "Mr. Munson, he's…"
Dustin, "He's a hero."
Mike, "Oh Jesus."
Mike, "Holy shit."
Mike, "This place is a total disaster."
Jonathan, "Yeah."
Jonathan, "Well, that's a bit of a problem."
Argyle, "I get we gotta hide Supergirl,"
Argyle, "but this isn't exactly the Fortress of Solitude, man."
Argyle, "It's more like a fortress of grodiness."
Mike, "Come on, guys, seriously."
Mike, "I've seen Mike's room look worse than this."
Argyle, "Ah, brutal, dude."
Mike, "Water still works."
Mike, "And, voilà. Cleaning supplies."
Jonathan, "All right. That's good."
Jonathan, "Hold it right there."
Nancy, "What's he doing?"
Jonathan, "Looks like he's gathering mushrooms."
Nancy, "He's a little on the eccentric side."
Jonathan, "Welcome to the club, right?"
Nancy, "Yeah, welcome to the club."
Mike, "Hey, Nancy?"
Nancy, "Yeah?"
Mike, "I'm sorry I wasn't here."
Nancy, "Oh. I mean…"
Nancy, "To be honest, I'm kinda glad you weren't."
Nancy, "I just mean, I'm glad you were with Mike."
Nancy, "And Will."
Nancy, "And I'm… I'm glad you were here too."
Nancy, "Otherwise, who'd have been in charge?"
Nancy, "Steve?"
Nancy, "He's actually grown up quite a bit, you know?"
Mike, "Yeah."
Mike, "Yeah, I'm sure."
Mike, "Hey."
Nancy, "Yeah?"
Mike, "Are we okay?"
Nancy, "Yeah."
Mike, "Yeah?"
Nancy, "Yeah, totally."
Nancy, "Yeah, it's… it's just…"
Nancy, "You know, it's hard."
Nancy, "I feel like"
Nancy, "life keeps throwing things in the way of our big plans."
Mike, "Yeah, sure seems like that."
Mike, "You think it's too late to throw 'saving the world' on your college resume?"
Nancy, "Your… Your application letter…"
Nancy, "Not that it matters at all anymore, but…"
Nancy, "Did it ever come?"
Mike, "No. No, uh…"
Mike, "Not yet."
Mike, "Did she… talk to you at all?"
Will, "Not much."
Will, "I mean, a little bit."
Mike, "Dr. Brenner."
Mike, "He says that she wasn't ready."
Mike, "And now she's starting to think he was right."
Will, "That's crap."
Will, "If it wasn't for her, if she hadn't left the lab,"
Will, "Max wouldn't be alive right now."
Mike, "I know."
Mike, "It's just, she's, um…"
Mike, "She's never lost before."
Mike, "Not like this."
Will, "She'll have another chance."
Mike, "Let's hope not."
Mike, "Let's hope One is dead and rotting."
Will, "He's not."
Will, "Now that I'm here, in Hawkins,"
Will, "I can feel him."
Will, "And he's hurt."
Will, "He's hurting."
Will, "But he's still alive."
Will, "It's strange, knowing now who it was this whole time, but…"
Will, "I can still remember what he thinks,"
Will, "and how he thinks."
Will, "And he's not going to stop."
Will, "Ever."
Will, "Not until he's taken everything."
Will, "And everyone."
Will, "We have to kill him."
Mike, "And we will."
Mike, "We will."
Mike, "Government."
Eleven, "Max?"
Eleven, "Max?"
Eleven, "Max!"
Eleven, "Max!"
Eleven, "Max!"
Hopper, "Hey, kid."
Eleven, "Hi."
Eleven, "I kept it open."
Eleven, "I kept the door open three inches."
Hopper, "I know."
Eleven, "I never stopped believing."
Hopper, "Oh, I know. It's okay."
Hopper, "It's okay."
Hopper, "It's okay. I'm here."
Hopper, "I'm here."
Eleven, "You look…"
Hopper, "Not fat?"
Eleven, "And your hair."
