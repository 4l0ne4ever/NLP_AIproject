Jonathan,"Nancy! Come on, come on. Where are you?"
Nancy,"Jonathan! Jonathan! I'm right here!"
Jonathan,"Nancy! Follow my voice, Nancy, I'm right here!"
Nancy,"Jonathan, where are you? I'm right here!"
Jonathan,"Just follow my voice! I'm right here!"
Unknown,"I just don't understand why we're coming out here. She obviously doesn't wanna talk to you."
Steve,"That's not it. She was acting weird. I mean, something was wrong."
Unknown,"Oh, really? Because no girl would ever blow off King Steve. So what? Like, you're worried about her?"
Steve,"What?"
Unknown,"Aw, you are. Aw, Steve has a heart. Oh, Stevey's in love. Who knew?"
Steve,"Would you just stop? Would you just shut up?"
Carol,"Damn. Sorry."
Steve,"So this is it, huh? Princess' castle. I'll just be a minute."
Joyce,"Look, we gotta go through this again."
Hopper,"I told you everything that I saw. Upstairs. There was a laboratory. It was where they must do experiments or something, and then there was this kid's room."
Joyce,"Oh, gosh. Tell me again. How do you know it was a kid's room?"
Hopper,"More like a prison. The size of the bed, there was a drawing, there was a stuffed animal."
Joyce,"You didn't say there was a drawing."
Hopper,"Yeah, there was a drawing of an adult and a child. It said 'Eleven' on it."
Joyce,"Was it good?"
Hopper,"It was a kid's drawing, Joyce. It was stick figures. Wasn't Will."
Joyce,"Earl... The night that Benny died, Earl said he saw some kid with a shaved head with Benny. Now, I pressed him, he said it might be Will, but maybe it wasn't?"
Hopper,"Look, this woman, Terry Ives, she claims to have lost her daughter, Jane. She sued Brenner, she sued the government. Now, the claims came to nothing, but what if I mean, what if this whole time I've been looking for Will, I've been chasing after some other kid?"
Nancy,"Better?"
Jonathan,"Yeah."
Nancy,"Is this okay? Uh, I found it in the closet. I can go home. I just figured..."
Jonathan,"Yeah, no. I don’t wanna be alone."
Nancy,"Do you?"
Jonathan,"No. Uh... no."
Nancy,"Can you just come up here?"
Jonathan,"Yeah."
Nancy,"Do you want the lights off, or..."
Jonathan,"On."
Nancy,"Yeah. You know, it can’t get us in here."
Jonathan,"We don't know that."
Hopper,"Uh, yeah, it’s Ives. Terry Ives. That’s with a 'Y.' Yeah, I got a pen. Hang on. Great, thanks. I really appreciate this, Frank. Say hi to the boys for me, too, would you?"
Joyce,"Did you get it?"
Hopper,"I got it."
Nancy,"Hey. Couldn’t sleep?"
Jonathan,"Every time I close my eyes, I just keep seeing that thing."
Nancy,"Wherever I was, that place I think that it lives there. It was feeding there. Feeding on that deer. That means that if Will and Barbara..."
Jonathan,"Hey. My mom said she talked to Will. If he’s alive, there’s a chance Barbara is, too."
Nancy,"That means that she’s trapped in that place. We have to find it again."
Jonathan,"You wanna go back out there?"
Nancy,"Maybe we don’t have to. When I saw it, it was feeding on that deer. Meaning it’s a predator, right?"
Jonathan,"Right."
Nancy,"And it seems to hunt at night, like a lion or a coyote. But it doesn’t hunt in packs like them. It’s always alone, like a bear. And remember at Steve’s, when Barb cut herself? And then, last night, the deer it was bleeding, too."
Jonathan,"One sec. Sharks can detect blood in one part per million. That’s one drop of blood in a million, and they can smell it from a quarter mile away."
Nancy,"So you’re saying it can detect blood?"
Jonathan,"It’s just a theory."
Nancy,"We could test it. But if it works at least we’ll know it’s coming."
Karen,"Honey, are you up?"
Nancy,"Yeah, I’m I’m getting dressed."
Karen,"I, uh, made some blueberry pancakes."
Nancy,"I’ll be down in a second."
Jonathan,"Your mom doesn’t knock?"
Unknown,"Hi. Scott Clarke?"
Scott,"Uh, yes."
Unknown,"The same Scott Clarke who teaches science and AV at Hawkins Middle?"
Scott,"The very same."
Unknown,"Oh, wonderful. And we’re making a newsletter, which we’ll send out monthly. It’ll showcase all the latest equipment, as well as how-to articles, which the kids write themselves."
Scott,"Oh, that’s neat."
Unknown,"What we’re really trying to do here, Mr. Clarke Scott what we’re trying to do here, Scott, is to connect kids from all over the state and give them the support and encouragement to pursue careers in technology. We feel these are the kinds of kids that are going to make Indiana proud."
Scott,"I agree, yes. Completely."
Unknown,"So, you know any kids you think might wanna participate?"
Scott,"Oh, I have a few in mind."
Mike,"I just I can’t believe she didn’t come back."
Dustin,"She’s gotta be close. She said it wasn’t safe. She just messed up the compasses because she wanted to protect us. She didn’t betray us."
Mike,"Mike, calm down. I shouldn’t have yelled at her. I never should’ve done that."
Dustin,"Mike, this isn’t your fault."
Mike,"Yeah, it’s Lucas’."
Dustin,"It wasn’t his fault, either. He wasn’t way out of line? Totally, but so were you! And so was Eleven."
Mike,"Oh, give me a break!"
Dustin,"No, Mike, you give me a break! All three of you were being a bunch of little assholes! I was the only reasonable one. But the bottom line is you pushed first. And you know the rule. You draw first blood no way! I’m not shaking his hand."
Mike,"No, I’m not."
Dustin,"This isn’t a discussion. This is the rule of law. Obey or be banished from the party. Do you wanna be banished?"
Mike,"No."
Dustin,"Good. Where are we going?"
Mike,"Where do you think? We’re going to get Lucas. And then we’re gonna find Eleven."
Unknown,"Today is a very special day. Do you know why? Because today, we make history. Today, we make contact."
Karen,"Here you go."
Unknown,"Ah yum."
Karen,"Okay. Now, sweetie, swallow the pancake. Where is Nancy? I thought she was coming down."
Unknown,"She is. Uh, she was. I don’t know."
Karen,"Nancy, what’s taking so long? Nancy? Nancy, come on."
Mike,"What do you want?"
Lucas,"I drew first blood, so okay, I’ll shake. On one condition. We forget the weirdo and go straight to the gate."
Mike,"Then the deal’s off."
Lucas,"Fine!"
Mike,"Fine!"
Dustin,"No, no, not fine! Guys, seriously? Do you even remember what happened on the Bloodstone Pass?"
Lucas,"We couldn’t agree on what path to take, so we split up the party and those trolls took us out one by one. And it all went to shit. And we were all disabled! So we stick together, no matter what!"
Mike,"Yeah, I agree. But this is the party, right here in this room. El is one of us now."
Lucas,"Um, no, she’s not. Not even close! Never will be. She’s a liar, a traitor she was just trying to keep us safe! She didn’t mean to hurt you. It was an accident!"
Mike,"An accident?"
Lucas,"All right, accident or not admit it, it was a little awesome."
Mike,"Awesome?"
Lucas,"Yeah, she threw you in the air with her mind!"
Mike,"I could have been killed! Which is exactly why we need her. She’s a weapon! Do you seriously wanna fight the Demogorgon with your wrist rocket? That’s like R2-D2 going to fight Darth Vader. We’re no use to Will if we’re dead."
Lucas,"If you two wanna waste your time looking for a traitor, go ahead, ‘cause I’m not spending my time on her anymore. No way! I’m going to the gate. I’m gonna find Will."
Dr. Brenner,"It’s okay, Eleven. Don’t be frightened. These are all friends. They’re just here to watch. Don’t focus on them. Stay in here, like before."
Eleven,"Yes, Papa."
Dr. Brenner,"Now, remember. Whatever it is, it can’t hurt you. Not from here. So there’s nothing to be frightened of. It’s reaching out to you ‘cause it wants you. It’s calling you so don’t turn away from it this time. I want you to find it. Understand?"
Eleven,"Yes."
Man,"Are you lost? Is your mom here? Your dad?"
Eleven,"Mouth breather."
Unknown,"What should we do?"
Man,"Uh call the police."
Unknown,"Excuse me. Young lady! You know you have to pay for those! You have to pay for those! Stop right there! Thief! Thief!"
Becky,"Hi, we’re looking for Terry Ives. Does she live here?"
Hopper,"The Hawkins chief of police."
Becky,"And you want to talk to my sister? Okay, well, you can come in, but if you want Terry to tell you anything, you’re about five years too late."
Joyce,"Terry, you have some visitors. Hello. My name’s Joyce Byers. Uh, this is Hopper. We drove over from Hawkins. Um, you see, uh, my son he’s been missing for almost a week now, and, um, we were wondering if we could talk to you about your daughter, Jane? If there’s anything that you could tell us about when she was taken what was your relationship with Dr. Brenner? You guys keep in touch?"
Hopper,"This is, uh this is him. This is Will. Uh, you may have seen him on on the news."
Joyce,"What’s wrong with her?"
Becky,"I told you, you’re wasting your time."
Dustin,"This is weird without Lucas."
Mike,"He should’ve shaken my hand."
Dustin,"He’s just jealous. Sometimes, your total obliviousness just blows my mind. He’s your best friend, right?"
Mike,"Yeah I mean, I don’t know."
Dustin,"It’s fine. I get it. I didn’t get here until the fourth grade. He had the advantage of living next door. But none of that matters. What matters is that he is your best friend. And then this girl shows up and starts living in your basement, and all you ever want to do is pay attention to her."
Mike,"That’s not true."
Dustin,"Yes, it is. And you know it. And he knows it. But no one ever says anything until you both start punching and yelling at each other like goblins with intelligence scores of zero. Now everything’s weird."
Mike,"He’s not my best friend."
Dustin,"Yeah, right."
Mike,"I mean, he is, but so are you. And so is Will."
Dustin,"Can’t have more than one best friend."
Mike,"Says who?"
Dustin,"Says logic."
Mike,"Well, I call bull on your logic, because you’re my best friend, too."
Dustin,"Okay."
Becky,"She was a part of some study in college."
Hopper,"MK Ultra?"
Becky,"Yeah, that’s the one. Was, uh, started in the ‘50s. By the time Terry got involved, it was supposed to be ramping down, but the drugs just got crazier. Messed her up good."
Hopper,"This was the CIA that ran this?"
Becky,"You and Terry would’ve gotten along. 'The Man,' with a big capital 'M.' They’d pay a couple hundred bucks to people like my sister, give ‘em drugs, psychedelics. LSD, mostly. And then they’d strip her naked and put her in these isolation tanks."
Hopper,"Isolation tanks?"
Becky,"Yeah. These big bathtubs, basically, filled with salt water, so you can float around in there. You lose any sense of sense and feel nothing, see nothing. They wanted to expand the boundaries of the mind. Real hippie crap. I mean, it’s not like they were forcing her to do any of this stuff. The thing is, though, is that she didn’t know she was pregnant at the time."
Hopper,"Jane."
Joyce,"Do you have any pictures of her?"
Becky,"I don’t think you guys understand. Terry miscarried in the third trimester. She keeps all of this up. Been doing it for 12 years. Terry, uh, pretends like Jane is real, like she’s gonna come home someday. Says she’s special. Born with 'abilities.'"
Hopper,"Abilities?"
Becky,"You read any Stephen King? Telepathy, telekinesis you know, shit you can do with your mind. That’s why the big, bad Man stole Jane away. Her baby’s a weapon, off fighting the commies. You know, the doctors all say it’s a coping mechanism. You know, to deal with the guilt."
Hopper,"Do you think there is any chance she could be telling the truth? About having had the kid."
Becky,"There is no birth certificate, nothing from the hospital. Doctors and nurses all confirm that she miscarried."
Hopper,"Yeah, but that could’ve been covered up. Right?"
Becky,"Like I said, you and Terry would’ve gotten along."
Nancy,"And I’ll have four boxes of the .38s."
Unknown,"What you kids doin’ with all this?"
Nancy,"Monster hunting."
Unknown,"Huh. 'Monster hunting'?"
Nancy,"You know, last week I was shopping for a new top I thought Steve might like. It took me and Barb all weekend. It seemed like life or death, you know? And and now"
Jonathan,"You’re shopping for bear traps with Jonathan Byers."
Nancy,"Yeah."
Jonathan,"What’s the weirdest part? Me or the bear trap?"
Nancy,"You. It’s definitely you."
Reed,"Hey, Nance! Can’t wait to see your movie."
Nancy,"What the hell was that?"
Jonathan,"I don’t know."
Carol,"Tommy, you write like a three-year-old."
Tommy,"Shut up!"
Nicole,"I didn’t know you could spell."
Carol,"Aw, hey there, princess!"
Tommy,"Uh-oh! She looks upset."
Nancy,"What is wrong with you?"
Steve,"What’s wrong with me? What’s wrong with you? I was worried about you. I can’t believe that I was actually worried about you."
Nancy,"What are you talking about?"
Steve,"I wouldn’t lie if I were you. You don’t want to be known as the lying slut now, do you?"
Tommy,"Speak of the devil."
Nancy,"You came by last night?"
Steve,"Ding! Ding! Ding! Does she get a prize? Look, I don’t know what you think you saw, but it wasn’t like that."
Nancy,"What, you just let him into your room to study? We were just"
Steve,"Or for another pervy photo session? You were just what? Finish that sentence. Finish the sentence."
Nancy,"Go to hell, Nancy."
Jonathan,"Come on, Nancy, let’s just leave."
Steve,"You know what, Byers? I’m actually kind of impressed. I always took you for a queer, but I guess you’re just a little screw-up like your father. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, that house is full of screw-ups. You know, I guess I shouldn’t really be surprised. A bunch of screw-ups in your family. I mean, your mom I’m not even surprised what happened to your brother."
Nancy,"Steve, shut up!"
Steve,"I’m sorry I have to be the one to tell you, but the Byers, their family, it’s a disgrace to the entire"
Nancy,"Jonathan, leave it."
Tommy,"Get in there, he’s going to hurt himself!"
Carol,"Get off of him, seriously! Get off! Stop!"
Nancy,"Stop! Steve! Knock it off, you guys! Jonathan, stop! Stop! You’re going to hurt him! Guys Jonathan, get off of him! Stop it! You have to stop!"
Tommy,"Cops! Cops! Come on! Just go, Carol!"
Unknown,"Hey. Hey! Get out of here! Get out of here! Get out of here! He’s had enough, man! I said he’s had enough!"
Callahan,"Kids! All right! Oh! My nose! Get back here! Get back here, you little punks!"
Powell,"Calm him down!"
Jonathan,"Get off!"
Hopper,"Well, thank you for your time. We appreciate it."
Becky,"Hmm, yeah, I’m sorry I couldn’t be of more help."
Hopper,"Good luck."
Joyce,"Yeah, like Terry found her daughter?"
Hopper,"We’re close. And then she shows up at Benny’s five nights ago, which means we’ve got a chance."
Joyce,"You know what I would give? For a chance? You know what I would give?"
Callahan,"Hey, Chief, you there? Yeah, a fight broke out here and it’s Jonathan Byers. You haven’t seen Joyce, have you?"
Unknown,"Do you think we’ll be out of here soon?"
Callahan,"You, yes. Him, no. He assaulted a police officer."
Nancy,"Well, how long are you gonna keep him?"
Callahan,"You and your boyfriend have big plans, do you?"
Nancy,"He’s not my boyfriend."
Callahan,"I think you better tell him that. Only love makes you that crazy, sweetheart. And that damn stupid."
Nancy,"Found some ice."
Jonathan,"Thanks."
Nancy,"Everything okay?"
Jonathan,"Yeah. Everything’s fine."
Dustin,"El!"
Mike,"Eleven! El! Eleven!"
Dustin,"Hey, stop. Do you hear that?"
Mike,"El?"
Troy,"Hey, there, Frogface."
Dustin,"Toothless."
Mike,"Shit! Run, Mike!"
Dustin,"Move, Mike! Mike, come on, run!"
Troy,"You’re dead, Wheeler."
Dustin,"Just keep going! Keep going!"
Mike,"Stay back! Don’t come any closer!"
Troy,"Nice throw, numbnuts. Stay back, or I cut him! I want to know how you did it!"
Mike,"How I did what?"
Troy,"I know you did something to me. Some nerdy science shit to make me do that."
Mike,"You mean piss your pants?"
Dustin,"Our friend has superpowers, and she squeezed your tiny bladder with her mind."
Troy,"Shut up! I think I should save Toothless here a trip to the dentist. Help him lose the rest of his baby teeth."
Mike,"Let him go. Let him go!"
Troy,"I’ll let him go, sure. But first it’s your turn. Wet yourself. Jump or Toothless here gets an early trip to the dentist."
Dustin,"Stop! No! Mike, don’t do it. I don’t need my baby teeth, Mike! Mike, seriously, don’t!"
James,"Troy, I don’t think this is a good idea, man."
Troy,"Dentist’s office opens in five four! Three! Two! One!"
Dustin,"Mike, don’t! Seriously, don’t do it, man! Seriously, don’t! Mike!"
Mike,"Holy shit."
Troy,"She broke my arm! My arm! Let’s get out of here! Let’s go!"
James,"Go!"
Dustin,"Yeah, that’s right! You better run! She’s our friend and she’s crazy! You come back here and she’ll kill you! You hear me? She’ll kill you, you sons of bitches! She’ll kill you, you hear me?"
Mike,"El, are you okay? El?"
Eleven,"Mike I’m sorry."
Mike,"Sorry? What are you sorry for?"
Eleven,"The gate I opened it. I’m the monster."
Mike,"No. No, El, you’re not the monster. You saved me. Do you understand? You saved me."
Unknown,"I have eyes on ‘em now. They’re heading home."
