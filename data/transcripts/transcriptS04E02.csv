unknown,"Looks like that Munson boy's up to no good again."
unknown,"Mr. Munson."
unknown,"Where is she?"
Eddie,"I just found her there. I swear, I don’t even know her name. I never seen her 'fore."
unknown,"Just calm down and stay back."
man,"What you boys doing?"
officer,"Holy mother of God."
unknown,"Hey!"
unknown,"You can’t be out here. Get back inside. Back inside."
Powell,"Hey, Frank. Chief Powell here. Listen… We caught a body over here at the Munsons’ trailer. I don’t even know how to describe it. I’ve never seen anything like it. Uh, look… I need you down here ASAP to tell me what the hell I’m looking at, or how someone could even do something like this."
attendant,"Flight 623 just landed from Indianapolis and will be arriving at gate two. Flight 623 from Indianapolis at gate two."
Mike,"Mike. Oh, careful, careful, careful. You’re squishing your present. It’s a gift. I, uh... I handpicked those for you in Hawkins. I know you like yellow, but now I’m realizing it’s too much yellow. I know you also like purple, so I got purple as well. So I kinda did, like, a 70/30 split kinda thing."
Eleven,"They’re perfect. Thank you."
Will,"Hey. How you doing?"
Mike,"Hey, Mike. How you doing? Yeah, good, man. Great. Uh, what’s that?"
Will,"Um, it’s nothing. Just this painting I’ve been working on."
Mike,"Cool. That’s a rad shirt, man. Ocean Pacific?"
Jonathan,"Oh, hey, Mike. This is, uh, my friend Argyle."
Mike,"Oh. Hey."
Argyle,"Oh no, no, no. No, it’s a shitty knockoff. Yeah. But don’t sweat it. I’ll get you the good threads out here. I heard a lot about your sister."
Jonathan,"Uh. O-Okay. Um, should we go?"
Argyle,"Yeah, this is kinda awkward, man."
Mike,"Yeah, so awkward."
Argyle,"I really thought it was Ocean Pacific."
Eleven,"I have our whole day planned. First, El Rodeo for burritos."
Mike,"What, really? Burritos for breakfast?"
Eleven,"Yes. Trust me."
Mike,"Yeah, no, I… I trust you. It’s just, you know, a little weird."
Eleven,"Then, after burritos, I want to go to Rink-O-Mania."
Mike,"Rink-O-Mania, okay. What’s Rink-O-Mania?"
Eleven,"It’s the most fun place in Lenora. They have skating and games."
Mike,"Sounds awesome. Are your friends gonna meet us?"
Eleven,"Friends? What… What friends?"
Mike,"You know, Stacy and Angela."
Eleven,"Angela? You’ll meet them, I promise. Just not today. I want today to be about me and you."
unknown,"Where to?"
Jonathan,"4819 Lonzo Way."
unknown,"Let’s go. This is life or death. Snap, snap!"
driver,"Yes, sir."
Robin,"Then Vicki laughed. And it wasn’t like a cheap, fake laugh either. It was like… It was a real, genuine laugh. Of course. It’s my Muppet joke. It’s hilarious. My point is that Vicki laughed and everything was just like… It was perfect."
Steve,"But?"
Robin,"But I’m having this problem where it’s like, I should stop talking. I have said everything I need to say. But then I guess I get nervous, and the words keep spilling out, and it’s like my… my brain is moving faster than my mouth, or… or rather my… my mouth is moving faster than my brain. I’m digging this hole for myself, and I want to stop digging, I’m trying to stop, but I can’t. And I’m doing it right now, aren’t I?"
Steve,"Yeah, you are."
Robin,"Oh, I’m hopeless."
Steve,"Eh. We both are."
Robin,"If only we could just, like, combine."
Steve,"Combine?"
Robin,"No, think about it. I know exactly what I want, and I’ve found the girl of my dreams, but I can’t get the courage to ask her out. Meanwhile, you go on a million dates. And you have no idea what you want."
Steve,"Mm. So if we just combined, all our problems would be solved."
Robin,"Because, I mean, alone, let’s face it… We totally suck."
Steve,"Totally and utterly."
Robin,"Ooh, I think I found our morning movie. Doctor Zhivago."
Steve,"Ugh, you know I don’t do double VHS."
Robin,"But it’s about doomed love. Oh, well, that’s relatable."
Steve,"Precisely. Also, Julie Christie is b-b-bonkers hot in this. Like, seriously, the most beautiful creature I have seen in my life."
reporter,"We’re in the Forest Hills trailer park in east Roane County. We don’t have a lot of details now, but we can confirm that the body of a Hawkins High student was discovered early this morning. Police have not released the name… although we are told they’re currently in the process of notifying the family."
Steve,"Holy shit."
man,"You all right in there, Sinclair?"
Lucas,"I’m good. First hangover feels like you’re gonna split in two, but you’ll live."
reporter,"…occurred here is sure to touch a nerve across the community of Hawkins, which is still reeling from last year’s devastating mall fire. Over 30 innocent…"
reporter2,"…completely blocked off at…"
boy1,"Come on. Just hit it, man."
boy2,"Yo, just hit it. Piece of shit."
boy1,"There you go. See?"
reporter,"…Is newly appointed police chief Calvin Powell, who served as deputy under Chief Hopper."
boy2,"What’s this? I thought we were watching ThunderCats."
boy1,"Hawkins student got murdered."
boy2,"What?"
boy1,"Yeah, it’s on every channel."
reporter,"As you can see behind me, Chief Powell and the Hawkins Police Department are actively investigating the scene…"
boy2,"They say who it is?"
boy1,"No, not yet. Hey, maybe Chrissy didn’t stand you up after all."
boy2,"Hey, don’t say that."
boy1,"Relax, it was a joke."
boy2,"A joke? Come on, someone just died and you’re making a joke out of it?"
boy1,"It was at the trailer park, so probably some druggy OD’d on heroin or some shit."
boy2,"Oh, see, that makes it funnier."
boy1,"What is up your ass this morning? It was a joke."
reporter,"We also don’t yet know if foul play was involved. But whatever has occurred here is sure to touch a nerve across Hawkins."
woman,"Ever since that girl, Barb, died a few years ago, it has been one thing after another. I’ll tell ya, you start to believe all those things they say, that this town is cursed, that the devil lives here in Hawkins."
Fred,"Nancy! I don’t think anyone’s gonna care about the basketball game anymore."
Nancy,"Nancy? Earth to Nancy. What? Yeah. No, I know."
Fred,"I said I don’t think anyone’s gonna care about the game. Would you be up for a field trip?"
reporter,"Many of the residents we spoke to voiced similar concerns to us. Grief, shock, disbelief, anger. Everyone wants to know the same thing, how can so many tragedies befall a once-peaceful town? All eyes are now on the police for answers. Is the new chief of police, Powell, in over his head? Or is he the very savior this town needs? We’ll be here the rest of the day right here on channel nine, where we’ll keep you posted on all the latest developments. In the meantime, we recommend you keep your doors and windows locked tight."
Beverly Moss,"This is Beverly Moss, signing off for…"
unknown,"My heart can’t take it anymore. It just can’t take it."
Dustin,"Chrissy Cunningham? You’re sure it was Chrissy?"
Max,"Yes, in her cheerleader outfit. Same thing she was in when I saw her with Eddie."
Dustin,"Did you tell all this to the cops?"
Max,"No. No, but I… I can’t be the only one who saw them together. They stood out."
Dustin,"Eddie the freak with Chrissy the cheerleader?"
Max,"Exactly. You know, his name’s not in the news yet or anything, but I guarantee you Eddie is suspect one now."
Dustin,"That’s crazy. Eddie didn’t do this. No way."
Max,"We can’t rule it out."
Dustin,"Yes, we can. You don’t know him like I do, Max. Okay? When we got to high school, Lucas made all his sports friends. Mike and me? I mean, no one was nice to us. No one except Eddie."
Max,"Okay. Well, they said the same shit about Ted Bundy. Yeah, he’s a super nice guy, but then he’s murdering women on the weekend."
Dustin,"So you’re saying Eddie is like Ted Bundy?"
Max,"No, I’m not saying... I’m saying that we can’t presume anything, okay? But it doesn’t look good for Eddie."
Dustin,"Why haven’t you told the cops this?"
Max,"I… I don’t know."
Dustin,"You don’t know?"
Max,"After I saw Eddie and Chrissy go in the trailer… something else happened. Nothing that weird or anything. I mean… Eddie always drives like a maniac, and the power goes off at my place all the time. It’s a piece of shit. But… This morning, I started to think back, and… I don’t know. The look on his face. He was scared, Dustin. Really scared. Maybe he was scared because, you know, he… he just killed someone, or… Maybe, um… Maybe be... because… I don’t… I don’t know, maybe… Something else killed her."
Dustin,"But that’s impossible. Right?"
Max,"I don’t know. It should be."
Dustin,"Only one person knows what actually happened."
Max,"Eddie."
Dustin,"Have you talked to anyone else?"
Max,"No. I can’t find Lucas or Nancy, and Mike’s in... California. Shit, shit, shit."
Dustin,"Where you going?"
Max,"To see a friend. You heard the news. It’s not safe. We’ll be careful. Thanks. Love you. Bye."
Murray,"'Hop is alive.' 'He looks ford to date.' 'Pleeze to make resarvazion, call seven-four-one-five-two,' blah, blah. 'Open 12 day P.E.T.T.' 'No government, please.' 'Kind regards, Enzo.'"
Joyce,"I like it even less in person."
Murray,"What do you mean, 'Like it less'?"
Joyce,"I don’t trust it."
Murray,"For starters, who the hell sent this?"
Joyce,"A friend?"
Murray,"A friend? Of Hop’s? 'Hop is alive. No government'? This looks and reads like a ransom note, and a bad one at that. There’s no proof of life here."
Joyce,"Yes, there is. It’s signed 'Enzo.'"
Murray,"So?"
Joyce,"So? There’s only two people who knew about our date at Enzo’s, and that’s me and Hop. So, whoever wrote this, Hop trusted enough to make him sign it Enzo. He’s sending me a message."
Murray,"You saw him die, Joyce."
Joyce,"I didn’t see a body."
Murray,"Because he evaporated."
Joyce,"Or… He survived."
Murray,"Okay. Okay. Let’s indulge this fantasy for a moment. He’s Houdini. He’s a cat man with nine lives. Whatever it is, he survives. What’s he doing in Russia? He was captured, that’s what. Then he probably met some new friends. And by friends, I mean the KGB. And believe me when I tell you, these people are the worst of the worst. I am talking torture, Joyce. And no matter how strong you think Jim is, they will break him. They will get his whole life story. And yes, that might very well include a planned date at Enzo’s with you, his co-conspirator, making this all an elaborate ruse to capture you as well."
Joyce,"You just made all that up."
Murray,"It’s a theory."
Joyce,"I prefer mine."
Murray,"So do I. Doesn’t make it right."
Joyce,"Well, either way, this could be real. Hopper could be alive."
Murray,"I suppose there’s only one way to find out."
Joyce,"What are you doing?"
Murray,"We’re gonna call that number and you’re going to find out who the hell sent you that letter. But we’re doing it… my way."
guard,"[in Russian] Where do you think you’re going?"
Hopper,"[in English] Tell me, who you work with? I told you, no one."
guard,"This woman, who is she?"
Hopper,"Why don’t you tell me? She’s wearing a Russian uniform."
guard,"[in Russian] Get the Elephant."
guard,"[in English] You want to die for this woman, American?"
Jonathan,"Hey, Will. We’ll be back at 6:00. Have fun, okay?"
Will,"Okay."
server,"You ordered fries?"
Eleven,"Have fun. Thanks. Bitchin’, right?"
Mike,"Yeah, bitchin’. Do you come here a lot?"
Eleven,"Yeah."
Will,"No."
Eleven,"Will does not, but I go to parties here."
Will,"No... It’s a big party place."
Eleven,"Oh, I forgot. You need socks."
Mike,"Oh, shit."
Eleven,"They… They sell them at the counter."
Mike,"Oh, okay."
Will,"How’d you forget about the socks? I mean, since you come here all the time."
Eleven,"I… I don’t know. I just forgot."
Mike,"Right."
Will,"Why do you keep lying? What? Why do you keep lying to Mike?"
Eleven,"I’m not lying."
Will,"You’re not? You’re friends with Angela and Stacy and you come to parties here?"
Eleven,"I have been to a party here."
Will,"For Mom’s work. That’s not what you implied."
Eleven,"I just… I don’t think Mike’s gonna like that you’re lying to him. And he doesn’t deserve that. When he finds out, he’s gonna be mad."
Mike,"Okay, so, I asked for vomit green and I got vomit green. Isn’t that awesome? I’m so bad at this, I’m like Bambi on ice."
Eleven,"No, you’re good. You got this."
teen,"That’s what it’s all about, right?"
unknown,"Oh my God, guys. Check it out."
unknown,"Who’s that twig with her?"
unknown,"I don’t know. But it seems like the snitch has a boyfriend."
