Billy,"I'm sorry, I did not quite catch your name."
Max,"What happened?"
Unknown,"Help me. No! Which one? I don't know. Hey, there's nothing to worry about anymore, okay? It doesn't make sense."
Unknown,"What doesn't make sense?"
Unknown,"Heather. The blood. The ice. Heather had a fever, so she took a cold bath, but she's better now. That has to be it. I don't know where that blood came from, but... we saw her. We both saw her. She's totally fine."
Unknown,"What about Billy?"
Unknown,"What about him?"
Unknown,"He seemed wrong."
Unknown,"Wrong is kind of like his default. But it's nice to know he's not a murderer, because that would've totally sucked."
Unknown,"Who... is that? See, this is why you can't just hang out with Mike all the time. This is Wonder Woman. AKA Princess Diana. She's from Paradise Island, which is, like, this hidden island where there are only women Amazon warriors."
Mrs. Driscoll,"Let me go! Let me go! I have to go back! I have to go back! I have to go back! I have to go back!"
Unknown,"Doris, we need you to stay calm for us, okay? Stay calm."
Unknown,"Okay, so, you two want to explain to me what in the name of Jesus just happened here?"
Unknown,"Tom! Hi, Daddy."
Tom,"Heather... sweetie... whatever this is, whatever he's got you into, you don't have to do this. You can stop this."
Heather,"There is no stopping it, Daddy. You'll see."
Tom,"No. Heather, please! Heather! No. No. Heather! Heather!"
Unknown,"Try not to move."
Unknown,"Jesus Christ."
Tom,"No. No..."
Joyce,"Hey, careful. Careful. Here."
Hopper,"Hey. Joyce."
Joyce,"Here, here, here. It's okay. That's it. Got it? Here."
Hopper,"How long have I been out?"
Joyce,"A while. You've been drifting in and out."
Hopper,"Yeah, but how did I get here?"
Joyce,"Slowly. What's the last thing you remember?"
Hopper,"Some thug attacked me."
Joyce,"Hey, you need to rest."
Hopper,"No, I'm fine."
Joyce,"No, you're not fine, Hop..."
Hopper,"I'm fine. I'm fine."
Joyce,"Um... Uh... Uh... They were soaked. I mean, did you recognize him?"
Hopper,"Where are my clothes? Who?"
Joyce,"The thug."
Hopper,"Well, I didn't get a good look."
Joyce,"Well, I mean, he's gotta be government, right?"
Hopper,"Yeah, but if he's government, what's he doing slinking around? W-Why is he running? You know, why didn't we find anything down there? Let's ask him."
Hopper,"What is that?"
Joyce,"His license plate. What are the dashes? Well, they're blanks. There was... I think it was either an H or a P with the part rubbed off. And there was definitely a Y. For sure. And that, I think, was a B, but it could've been an eight. And that... Wait..."
Hopper,"I think you should stick to sales. Can't you run a search or something?"
Joyce,"I just think you have to lower your expectations. I mean, this is a state government agency. Gonna take weeks before they find a match."
Hopper,"Weeks?"
Joyce,"If we're lucky. And, I mean, what are the odds that this guy registers a car in his own name?"
Hopper,"It wasn't a car. Uh, what are you wearing?"
Joyce,"What do you mean it wasn't a car?"
Lucas,"Do you copy? This is a code red. I repeat, this is a code red. Max. Do you copy? This is a code red."
Max,"Shut... up."
Lucas,"She turned it off."
Max,"I'm sleeping. Go away."
Mike,"This is Mike. Do not hang up. Something happened, something bad. Our very lives can be at stake."
Max,"What are you talking about?"
Mike,"Just come over to my house. We'll explain everything."
Max,"What? Hurry."
Unknown,"What did he say?"
Lucas,"Try Dustin again."
Unknown,"He's not answering."
Lucas,"So, try him again. Dustin, do you copy? I repeat, this is a code red."
Dustin,"That keycard opens the door, but unfortunately, the Russian with this keycard also has a massive gun. Whatever's in this room, whatever's in those boxes, they really don't want anybody finding it. But there's gotta be a way in."
Steve,"Well, you know... I could just take him out."
Dustin,"Take who out?"
Steve,"The Russian guard. What? I sneak up behind him, I knock him out, and I take his keycard. It's easy."
Dustin,"Did you not hear the part about the massive gun?"
Steve,"Yes, Dustin, I did. And that's why I would be sneaking."
Dustin,"Ah. Well, please, tell me this, and be honest, have you ever actually... won a fight?"
Steve,"Okay, that was one time..."
Dustin,"Twice. Jonathan. Year prior? Why wouldn't it? Because it looks like he beat the shit out of you. You got a fat lip, crooked nose, swollen eye, a lot of blood..."
Steve,"It was... things that all added up..."
Dustin,"That just might work."
Steve,"Robin. Hey, Robin! Hey, what... what are you doing?"
Robin,"I need cash."
Steve,"Well, half of that's mine. Where're you going?"
Robin,"To find a way into that room, a safe way. And, in the meantime, sling ice cream, behave, and don't get beat up. I'll be back in a jiff."
Dustin,"Oh, dude. Come on, man, not my scooper."
Man,"If he gets us the layout by noon, we can."
Woman,"Okay, I'll let him know."
Man,"Dunno if they'll go through with it, but I just thought you should know."
Unknown,"Nancy."
Unknown,"Jonathan."
Tom,"I've worked at this paper for twenty-five years. Twenty-five... years. Now, we're a small-town paper, but we have something the big papers don't have: trust. The trust of our community."
Unknown,"Tom, if you just..."
Tom,"Do you know how I built that trust? By placing my faith in something the two of you don't seem to value a whole lot: facts. Facts. So, while we're here, let's go over the facts. Fact one: you disobeyed a direct order to stop pursuing this story. Two: you falsely identified yourselves as reporters, repeatedly lying to an elderly woman. Three: you broke into her home, committing trespass. Four: she almost died en route to the hospital."
Unknown,"She would've died if we hadn't shown up! Whatever disease that rat had clearly passed to her..."
Tom,"Five! Mrs. Driscoll is a paranoid schizophrenic. You didn't know that, did you? Now... disease-carrying rats? The second coming of the plague? Does this sound credible to you, or perhaps does this sound more like the delusions of a very sick old lady?"
Unknown,"I didn't know that."
Tom,"Her family's furious. So furious, in fact, they've threatened litigation."
Unknown,"Litigation? That's crazy."
Tom,"For once, we agree. This is crazy. In fact, in my entire professional career, I've never dealt with anything quite like it. But hopefully, hopefully, you've learned something valuable here. You've learned... how in the workplace, in the real world, there are consequences to your actions. Which brings me to my sixth and final... fact. You're fired. Both of you."
Will,"I didn't think it was anything at first. I mean, I think I just didn't want to believe it. The first time I felt it was at Day of the Dead."
Unknown,"Power went out that night, too."
Will,"And then I felt it again at the field near the Nelson farm the next day. Then again yesterday outside Castle Byers."
Lucas,"Will! What does it feel like?"
Will,"It's almost like... You know when you drop on a roller coaster?"
Unknown,"Sure. Yeah."
Unknown,"No."
Will,"It's like... everything inside your body is just sinking all at once, but... this is worse. Your body... it goes cold and... and you can't breathe. I've felt it before, whenever he was close."
Unknown,"Whenever who was close?"
Will,"The Mind Flayer. Go away! Go away! I closed the gate."
Unknown,"I know, but..."
Will,"what if he never left? What if we locked him out here with us? This is him. All of him. But, that day on the field, a part of him attached itself to me. My mom got it out of me..."
Joyce,"Get the hell out of my son!"
Will,"... and Eleven closed the gate. But the part that was still in me, what if it's still in our world? In Hawkins."
Unknown,"I don't understand. The Demodogs died when El closed the gate."
Max,"If the brain dies, the body dies."
Unknown,"We can't take any chances. We need to assume the worst. The Mind Flayer's back."
Will,"Yeah. And if he is, he'd want to attach himself to someone again. A new me. A new host."
Unknown,"How can you tell if someone is a host?"
Unknown,"Hey, is he in?"
Unknown,"Yes, he's busy at the moment, but..."
Hopper,"Great. Excuse me."
Unknown,"You should sit down."
Unknown,"... wouldn't listen..."
Unknown,"Tony, hold on. Let me, uh... I might have to... Let me call you back. Okay. Thanks."
Hopper,"Jim."
Larry,"I know, I know."
Hopper,"You're busy. I'm gonna make this fast, I promise. Is there... some kind of problem?"
Larry,"Yeah. You might say that."
Hopper,"Um, I'm looking for the name of a guy."
Larry,"The name of a guy."
Hopper,"Yeah, I think you might know this guy. He was here the other day. Rides a motorcycle. Big build, square jaw, dark hair. He's probably military, maybe ex-military? Is this ringing... any bells?"
Larry,"Uh... I don't think so."
Hopper,"Really? 'Cause it was just two days ago. This was right before I saw you."
Larry,"Oh!"
Hopper,"You know what?"
Larry,"What? Could be the maintenance guy. Maintenance. Yeah. I can't remember his name. Oh, God... Uh... Gary or John or something. Candice will have his name on file. We've had trouble with the plumbing. Clogged toilets and... sinks with minds of their own."
Hopper,"You meeting with a lot of plumbers, Larry?"
Larry,"Excuse me?"
Hopper,"This guy, when I saw him, he was coming out of your office."
Larry,"Okay, well, I don't remember that. I shake a lot of hands, you know?"
Hopper,"Do you remember when I caught you passed out in the hideaway with all that powder all over your nose? You remember? Do you remember when my boys found you and Candice going at it like a couple of bunnies in the back of your Cadillac? Do you remember that? Does your wife remember that?"
Larry,"You, uh... You really wanna play this game?"
Hopper,"Huh? Not a game, Lar."
Larry,"Okay. Those pills you used to swallow like candy. I can't recall, did you have a prescription for those? Or how about drinking on duty? Yeah. We have some real fun stories about that. One call to Tom at the Post... and you're done, buddy. You're gone. Oh, and, please, don't give me that dead daughter sob story, 'cause I just don't care. Now, if you don't mind, I really am rather busy. Operating directors..."
Larry,"Damn it! My nose! You broke my goddamn nose!"
Hopper,"And your friend almost killed me last night, so I'd say we're still not even."
Candice,"Larry?"
Hopper,"Let's cut the crap, Larry!"
Candice,"Larry!"
Hopper,"Who is this guy? Government? Military?"
Larry,"You're making a big mistake."
Hopper,"Who is he?"
Larry,"It's Arnold Schwarzenegger."
Candice,"Larry!"
Hopper,"Who you calling? The police? That is a nice ring you got there, Larry."
Larry,"Are you insane?"
Hopper,"I don't know. Let's find out."
Larry,"Okay, okay, okay. Be cool, be cool. I don't know his name, I swear. Ah, ah, ah!"
Hopper,"But you know him."
Larry,"He... He gives me things sometimes."
Hopper,"What kind of things?"
Larry,"Money. Presents. Aah! Gifts."
Hopper,"Who is this guy, Santa Claus?"
Larry,"Starcourt. Starcourt. He works for Starcourt."
Hopper,"The mall?"
Larry,"Yes, yes. Yeah, right. Aah! I swear! I swear! I swear! Starcourt. They... They own the mall. They want to expand to East Hawkins. They needed property, some land. Some people didn't want to sell, so I leaned on them a little. That's all. I swear, that's all."
Hopper,"Why do they want this land?"
Larry,"I don't know!"
Hopper,"You have records of these purchases, these, uh... these land purchases?"
Larry,"You don't want to mess with these people, Jim."
Hopper,"I think you should worry about yourself right now, Larry, not about me. The records. Where are they?"
Candice,"Larry?"
Hopper,"He just bumped his head. Just a little boo-boo, right, Lar? Have a nice day."
Candice,"Larry!"
Nancy,"It's bullshit. So, according to Tom, Driscoll's just a schizophrenic? And that rat is just a rat? And it's all, what, some big coincidence? You know what I think? I think Tom was on drugs."
Unknown,"Oddly, that's, uh, totally true. So, so, don't do this for us. Do it for your country. Do it for your fellow man. Do this for America... Erica."
Erica,"Ooh! I just got the chills. Oh, yeah, from this float, not your speech. Know what I love most about this country? Capitalism. Do you know what capitalism is?"
Unknown,"Yeah."
Erica,"Yeah. It means this is a free market system. Which means people get paid for their services, depending on how valuable their contributions are. And it seems to me, my ability to fit into that little vent is very, very valuable to you all. So, you want my help? This USS Butterscotch better be the first of many. And I'm talking free ice cream for life."
Hopper,"Wow, I love the place, Lar. Hey, you shoot that fella yourself?"
Larry,"That's... That's not real."
Hopper,"No shit! All right, so... what exactly are we looking at?"
Joyce,"Land deeds, transfers of property."
Hopper,"So your buddies at Starcourt, they suddenly start buying up all this property. They tell you why?"
Larry,"I already told you, they don't tell me anything."
Hopper,"They're just using you, I get it. What I don't get is why you have a bunch of land deeds in a safe in your bedroom."
Larry,"These people, Jim, they're bad news."
Hopper,"So, what, this is blackmail?"
Larry,"Protection."
Hopper,"Protection. Hold on a second. Hey, what is it?"
Joyce,"Hess Farm, Henry's place, Bullocks... Look, they're all here. They're all in Southeast Hawkins, right near Jordan Lake."
Hopper,"And what else is near Jordan Lake?"
Joyce,"The power plant. Four nights ago, there was a huge power outage, and the next day..."
Hopper,"Your magnets fell."
Joyce,"Yeah, I mean, Scott says that this machine would take a massive amount of power to run."
Hopper,"Yeah."
Joyce,"So, what if this machine that we've been talking about really does exist, and the reason that we didn't find it at the lab is because it isn't at the lab, it's at one of these properties."
Hopper,"Um... I want you to... forget about sales. I want you to come work for me at the Hawkins PD."
Joyce,"And have to look at your face every day? I don't think so."
Hopper,"Larry! Hey! Hey, where do you think you're going, pal?"
Karen,"Nancy? Nance?"
Nancy,"Maybe Jonathan's right. To be honest, I wasn't thinking about him. I wasn't thinking about anyone, really. I just... I wanted to be right. I wanted to be right so badly."
Karen,"And were you?"
Nancy,"I thought so. But maybe I just... don't want to admit that I'm wrong, because if I'm wrong, then..."
Karen,"You're what everyone thinks you are. Just a kid who has no idea what she's doing."
Karen,"It's not easy out there, Nance."
Nancy,"I know."
Karen,"People are always saying you can't. That you shouldn't. That you're not... smart enough, not good enough. This world, it... it beats you up again and again until eventually, I... Most people, they just... they just stop trying."
Karen,"But you're not like that. You're a fighter. You always have been. I honestly don't know where you get it from."
Nancy,"Dad."
Karen,"I think you were swapped in the hospital, to tell you the truth."
Nancy,"No."
Nancy,"I get it from you, Mom. I get it from you."
Karen,"Well, wherever you get it from, I'm proud of you."
Nancy,"Proud of me for getting fired?"
Karen,"That you stood up for yourself. That you stood up to those... shitheads."
Nancy,"Mom!"
Karen,"Yes, those shitheads. And if you believe in this story... Look at me, Nancy. ... finish it. Then go sell it to The Indianapolis Star or whatever and... I mean, can you imagine their faces when they read a story about their own town in a big paper like that? That would be... pretty amazing."
Karen,"So, why not?"
Nancy,"Why not?"
Karen,"Finish it."
Lucas,"Uh, Will? Um, you know, about yesterday..."
Will,"It's fine, Lucas. You don't have to say anything."
Lucas,"I know, but it's just... It was a really cool campaign. And Mike and I, we should've never..."
Will,"I don't care anymore, Lucas. I really don't. We have bigger things to worry about now."
Unknown,"This should hold him."
Mike,"Hey, I found the breakers."
Max,"Whoa, that thing is super creepy."
Mike,"Let me see it. I think this'll work. Right, buddy? Right, Mike."
Mike,"Hey, El... I just wanted to say... You know when I said Nana was sick? She wasn't. I lied."
Eleven,"I know."
Mike,"Right, right, right. No, I just... think it was important for you to know the context. Hopper, he went all crazy on me, telling me I'm spending way too much time with you. He made me lie. I mean, you're the most important thing to me in the world."
Eleven,"What if he's right?"
Mike,"What?"
Eleven,"Hop."
Mike,"No, no, no, no. He's just some angry old man who hates joy."
Eleven,"But if I only see you, and I'm a different species than you, then I should be with my species more."
Mike,"What are you talking about? That's totally against the rules."
Eleven,"Did you spy on me? I make my own rules."
Max,"Mike, are you there?"
Mike,"Yeah! Where are you guys? I'm coming. Just... hold on a second. Shit!"
Max,"God, I hope it's not you. I really hope it's not you."
Robin,"Erica, do you copy?"
Erica,"Mm-hmm. I copy. You nerds in position or what?"
Robin,"Yeah, we're in position. It's all quiet here, so you've got the green light."
Erica,"Green light, roger that. Commence Operation Child Endangerment."
Robin,"Can we maybe not call it that?"
Erica,"See you on the other side. Nerds."
Larry,"Winnie! Winnie, is that you?"
Winnie,"Larry?"
Larry,"Winnie, upstairs in the bedroom!"
Winnie,"Baby. Oh, my God, baby, what happened?"
Larry,"Get me a phone."
Winnie,"Baby..."
Larry,"Get me a goddamn phone!"
Joyce,"Anything?"
Hopper,"No. This place is dead."
Joyce,"All right, where to next? Hess Farm."
Erica,"All right, nerds. I'm there."
Robin,"Do you... Do you see anything?"
Erica,"Yeah, I see those boring boxes you're so excited about."
Robin,"Any guards?"
Erica,"Negative."
Robin,"Booby traps?"
Erica,"If I could see them, they'd be pretty shit traps, wouldn't they?"
Robin,"Thank you for that."
Erica,"I'm in. Free ice cream for life."
Billy,"Pool's closed. Hey. Do you hear me? Pool is closed!"
Mike,"Billy! Who's there? Billy! Who's there? Billy! Billy! You think this is funny, huh? Come and find me."
Billy,"I find you, it is your funeral."
Mike,"Come and get me. Come on! Billy! Billy. Got you. Come and get me, you piece of shit. Hey. Behind you. Hi. Now! Come on."
Unknown,"Got it."
Max,"Max."
Eleven,"Do it."
Nancy,"Hi. Uh, I'm here to see Doris Driscoll. I think she was admitted last night."
Unknown,"Name and relation?"
Nancy,"Uh... Nancy... Driscoll. I'm... Nancy Driscoll. Her... granddaughter."
Dustin,"That's definitely not Chinese food. Uh, maybe you guys should, you know, stand back."
Robin,"No."
Dustin,"Just... Just step back, okay?"
Robin,"No."
Dustin,"Step back. Seriously."
Robin,"No! No! If you die, I die."
Dustin,"Okay. What the hell?"
Robin,"What is that?"
Dustin,"Was that just me, or did the room move?"
Erica,"Booby traps."
Dustin,"You know what? Let's just grab that and go."
Dustin,"Which one do I press, Erica?"
Erica,"Just press the damn button, nerd."
Dustin,"Which one? I'm pressing the button, okay?"
Erica,"Press 'open door'."
Dustin,"I'm pressing 'open door'."
Erica,"Just open the... Press the other button."
Robin,"Out of the way so she can push the button... I'm trying."
Dustin,"Would you stop? Would you let me just do it? Would you stop?"
Robin,"Just open the door!"
Billy,"Max! Let me out of here! Let me out. You kids... You think this is funny? You kids think this is some kind of sick prank, huh? You little shits think this is funny? What is this? Open the door. Open the door! Open the door! Open the goddamn door!"
Unknown,"We're at 220."
Billy,"It's not my fault. It's not my fault. It's not my fault, Max. I promise you, it's not my fault."
Max,"What's not your fault, Billy?"
Billy,"I've done things, Max. Really... bad things. I didn't mean to. He made me do it."
Max,"Who made you do it?"
Billy,"I don't know, it's like a shadow. Like a giant shadow. Please, Max."
Max,"What did he make you do?"
Billy,"It's not my fault, okay? Max, please. Please, believe me, Max, it's not my fault. I tried to stop him, okay? I did. Please believe me, Max. Please believe me."
Max,"Billy, it's gonna be okay. It's gonna be okay. We want to help you. We want to help you. You just have to talk to us, okay? You have to talk to us. I believe you, Billy. We'll figure it out together, okay?"
Will,"I feel him. He's activated."
Max,"I need you to trust me. Please."
Mike,"Max, get away from the door. What? Get away from the door!"
Billy,"Let me out, you bitch! Let me out! I'll fucking gut you! Let me out!"
Max,"Max, come on! He can't get out, can he?"
Mike,"No way. No way. Go to hell, you piece of shit!"
Heather,"The girl, was it her?"
Billy,"Yeah. It was her. She knows now. She knows about me. She could've killed me."
Heather,"Yes. But not us."
Billy,"Not us."
