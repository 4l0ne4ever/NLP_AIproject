Hopper,"Hey, you reached Jim. I'm probably doing something incredible right now, and I can't..."
Will,"It's like... It's like I feel what the shadow monster's feeling. See what he's seeing."
Unknown,"Like in the Upside Down?"
Will,"Some of him is there. But some of him is here, too."
Unknown,"Here, like, in this house?"
Will,"In this house and... in me. It's like... It's like he's reaching into Hawkins more and more. And the more he spreads, the more connected to him I feel."
Unknown,"And the more you see these now-memories."
Will,"At first I just felt it in the back of my head. I didn't even really know it was there. It's like when you have a dream and you can't remember it unless you think really hard. It was like that. But now it's like... Now I remember. I remember all the time."
Unknown,"Maybe... Maybe that's good."
Will,"Good?"
Unknown,"Just think about it, Will. You're like a spy now. A superspy. Spying on the shadow monster. If you know what he's seeing and feeling... maybe that's how we can stop him. Maybe all of this is happening for a reason."
Will,"You really think so?"
Unknown,"Yeah. Yeah, I really do."
Will,"What if he figures out we're spying on him? What if he spies back?"
Unknown,"He won't."
Will,"How do you know?"
Unknown,"We won't let him."
man 1,"Hey."
man 2,"Hey. Did you get 'em?"
man 1,"Yeah."
Unknown,"We'd like a... uh, a room."
Unknown,"We got those. You want a single or a double?"
Unknown,"Double."
Nancy,"Nance... Uh, on or off?"
Jonathan,"Hmm. What? Nothing. Just... déjà vu."
Nancy,"Yeah. Don't you think it's weird?"
Jonathan,"What?"
Nancy,"How we only seem to hang out when the world's about to end?"
Jonathan,"It's not going to end."
Nancy,"Feels like it. Still have yours?"
Jonathan,"Yeah. Yeah, mine's bigger."
Nancy,"Congratulations."
Jonathan,"Thanks."
Nancy,"What happened?"
Jonathan,"What do you mean?"
Nancy,"To us? After everything, you just... disappeared."
Jonathan,"Yeah, Will needed me. And Steve..."
Nancy,"I waited."
Jonathan,"Yeah, like, only a month."
Nancy,"I want them off."
Will,"Mom? Mom? Mom?"
Joyce,"Yeah? You saw who, baby?"
Will,"I saw him. Hopper. I think he's in trouble. I think he's going to die."
Erica,"That's enough, Erica."
Unknown,"Uh-uh."
Lucas,"Dad?"
Mr. Sinclair,"Mmm-hmm?"
Lucas,"When Mom's mad at you, how do you make her not mad?"
Mrs. Sinclair,"Hmm. That's a great question. How do you, hon?"
Mr. Sinclair,"First, I apologize. Then, I get your mother whatever she wants."
Lucas,"Even when she's wrong?"
Mr. Sinclair,"She's never wrong, son."
Mrs. Sinclair,"That's right."
Lucas,"Not hungry?"
Unknown,"Where you goin'?"
Lucas,"To hang out with Dustin."
Lucas,"Sorry."
Claudia,"Mews! Mewsy! Mews! Mewsy!"
Claudia,"Dusty, baby, you're sure she's not in your room?"
Dustin,"Uh-huh."
Claudia,"Thank you so much, Mr. McCorkle. Thank you so much. You are a true lifesaver. All right, this was great. Thank you. All right. Have a good one. Bye-bye, now. All right. You, too."
Claudia,"All right, great news."
Dustin,"They found her?"
Claudia,"No. But they saw her wandering around Loch Nora. How did the poor baby get all the way out there?"
Dustin,"I don't know. Lost, I guess."
Claudia,"But they're gonna look for her. And I'll stay here, just in case they call again. And you're gonna go help look? Yeah? Yeah? Give me hug. Give me a hug. Go get her."
Dustin,"You're gonna find her."
Claudia,"Okay. We can find her."
Dustin,"We can find her."
Claudia,"I love you."
Dustin,"I love you."
Claudia,"I love you."
Dustin,"I love you."
Claudia,"All right, go."
Dustin,"All right."
Dustin,"All right, Dart. Breakfast time. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Shit. Shit. Shit. Shit. Shit. Shit. Shit. Shit. Shit. Shit. Shit. Shit. Shit. Shit. Shit. Shit. Come on. Come on, I know you're hungry. Yes. Yes, yes, yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Shit! I'm sorry. You ate my cat."
man,"All right. I think this is it."
Unknown,"Five-one-five Larrabee, right?"
man,"Yes. Five-fifteen."
Unknown,"All right, 'Five-fifteen.' Sure."
man,"Thank you."
Unknown,"Hey. You apologize to your mama, yeah? Huh?"
man,"Must be scared half to death. How long's it been?"
Unknown,"Long time."
Becky,"Go away! I'm not interested!"
Unknown,"Look, I don't want your Thin Mints, all right, kid? Or your religious mumbo jumbo. Whatever you're selling, I ain't buying, okay?"
Eleven,"I want to see Mama."
man,"Name a way you occupy your time when you're having a boring day at work."
Mike,"Drink coffee."
host,"'Drink coffee,' said Mike."
Lynn,"Visit with other employees."
host,"'Visit with other employees.'"
Terry,"Rainbow."
Eleven,"Mama?"
Terry,"Three to the right. Four to the left."
Eleven,"Mama, can you hear me?"
Terry,"Breathe. Sunflower. Rainbow. Three to the right. Four to the left. Four-fifty. Breathe."
Eleven,"Mama? It's me... Jane. I'm here now."
Terry,"Breathe. Sunflower. Rainbow. Four-fifty. Breathe. Sunflower. Rainbow."
Becky,"What's wrong with Mama?"
Terry,"Four-fifty."
Jonathan,"Are you positive this is the right place?"
Nancy,"'3833.' Yeah."
Jonathan,"All right."
Murray,"Look at the camera."
Jonathan,"What camera?"
Murray,"Not the loudspeaker. Above you, to the right."
Murray,"Nancy Wheeler. Jonathan Byers. You two are a long way from home. Well... I hope you didn't come all this way to tell me about the bear in the Harrington kid's backyard. I've heard that one already."
Murray,"Take a look. Go ahead, don't be shy. I followed up on 200 tips, most bogus, but that's how these things always go, okay? I know every last step Barbara took that day, every last person she talked to. The answer to what happened to your friend, it's up here somewhere. I assure you that. I just gotta connect the right dots."
Nancy,"Timeline's wrong."
Murray,"I'm sorry?"
Nancy,"Your timeline is wrong. And the girl with the buzzed hair, she's not Russian. She's from Hawkins Lab. Her name was Eleven."
Jonathan,"You might wanna sit down for this."
Unknown,"If you're not out in an hour..."
Max,"Walking home. Yeah, yeah, I know."
Billy,"Hey! Watch the attitude, shitbird."
Unknown,"Sorry about that, Road Warrior."
Max,"What happened?"
Unknown,"Short circuit in the motherboard. A real bummer. But fret not. I got another machine up and running in the back."
Unknown,"Hold these."
Max,"You better get me that date now, Sinclair."
Lucas,"I told you I would."
Unknown,"And keep things PG in here, all right?"
Lucas,"What is this shit, stalker?"
Max,"Sorry. I just needed a safe place."
Lucas,"A safe place to what? Be creepy?"
Max,"Listen. I'm gonna tell you the truth about everything that happened last year. But if anyone finds out, you could be arrested. Possibly killed."
Lucas,"Killed?"
Max,"I need to know. Do you accept the risk?"
Lucas,"Oh, my God! This... this is so stupid. Do you accept the risk?"
Max,"Yeah. Sure. Fine. I accept the risk."
Lucas,"Let's hear it. Last year... Will didn't get lost in the woods. He got lost somewhere else."
Joyce,"Hey, is this where you saw him? Is this where you saw Hopper?"
Will,"I think so. Yeah."
Joyce,"Okay."
Mike,"Here!"
Joyce,"Okay, so... so Hopper is here?"
Mike,"Yeah. Now we just need to find out where here is, right?"
Joyce,"Right."
Mike,"Did he say anything? I mean, before he left?"
Joyce,"Uh, some... something about vines?"
Bob,"Surprise. I would've called, but you said not to clog up the line."
Joyce,"You know, I... We're fine, we don't need anything."
Bob,"When I was sick as a kid, and I was sick all the time as a kid, nothing made me feel better than focusing on these brain teasers. Those are great. Ah... I could teach him how to play."
Joyce,"You know, he's sleeping."
Bob,"Okay. I could wait with you?"
Joyce,"Listen, it's just not a good time. But, um, you know what? I'll call you, okay?"
Bob,"Thank you. You sure?"
Joyce,"Yeah."
Bob,"Well, have him call me. They don't call me Bob the Brain for nothing."
Joyce,"Bob!"
Bob,"That's my name."
Bob,"You drew all these yourself?"
Joyce,"Mmm-hmm."
Bob,"Why, exactly?"
Joyce,"I... I told you the rules. No questions, okay?"
Bob,"Yeah."
Joyce,"We... we just need you to help us figure out what... Bob? Bob? Over here."
Bob,"Where... where this is."
Joyce,"That's the objective. Find the X."
Bob,"Yeah? What's at the X? Pirate treasure?"
Joyce,"Bob, no questions."
Bob,"Okay."
Joyce,"Let me talk to you for a second. Hang on, guys."
Bob,"Joyce, you can talk to me. You know that, right?"
Joyce,"Yeah. What's the problem, exactly?"
Bob,"What's the problem? Joyce, Will doesn't look well. You don't look well. What's going on?"
Joyce,"Nothing. Nothing."
Bob,"Is this an episode? Is this one of Will's episodes?"
Joyce,"No. No! No. I'm sorry. I just... I don't... see how any of this is good for Will, or for you. And even if I wanted to play along, I mean, how could I figure anything out if I don't understand the context of the game?"
Bob,"Or... What? What is it? I know that shape. It's Lovers' Lake. It's Lovers' Lake. I get it. Okay, I get. That's Lake Jordan. And if that's Lake Jordan, then you can probably find... Yeah, that's, uh, Sattler's quarry. And if you just follow it naturally... it moves to... the Eno River. And there it is. That's the Eno, do you see it? Okay, so the lines aren't roads. But they act like roads. And they act like roads 'cause when you follow 'em, you'll see... they don't go over water. And that's the giveaway. That's the giveaway. Ha! Don't you get it? It's not a puzzle, it's a map. It's a map of Hawkins."
Bob,"Right, Will?"
Hopper,"Does anybody copy? Look, if anybody copies, this is Jim Hopper, Hawkins' Chief..."
Dustin,"Guys, this is Dustin again. Does anyone copy? This is a code red. I repeat, a code red! I really need someone to pick up here. Hopper's MIA, and I've got a code red. Code red! All right, it's Dustin again. Seriously, I have a code red."
Erica,"Could you please shut up?"
Dustin,"Erica? Erica, is Lucas there? Where is he?"
Erica,"Don’t know. Don't care."
Dustin,"Is he with Mike?"
Erica,"Like I said, I don't know and I don't care."
Dustin,"Please tell him it's super important. Please tell him that I have a code..."
Erica,"Code red?"
Dustin,"Yep, code red. Exactly."
Erica,"Mmm-hmm. I got a code for you instead. It's called code shut-your-mouth."
Dustin,"Erica?"
Becky,"I just need a little help understanding, sweetie, okay? Can you tell me where you came from? Where you've been all this time?"
Becky,"A policeman and a woman came looking for you last year. Did they find you?"
Eleven,"She won't get better... will she?"
Becky,"They don't think so, no. But she's not in any pain. She's just stuck, they think. Like in a dream. A long dream."
Eleven,"A good dream?"
Becky,"I hope so."
Eleven,"Is it the same dream?"
Becky,"We don't know. Sometimes she says different words. But usually those."
Becky,"She always believed that you were out there. She always believed that you'd come home one day."
Eleven,"Home?"
Becky,"Yeah, home."
Becky,"Pretty. I can get you a real bed, and you can stay here with me if you want. How's that sound?"
Becky,"I wanna help you, but to really do that, I need you to talk to me, okay? Doesn't have to be now. Doesn't have to be today. But when you're ready. Okay?"
Eleven,"Okay."
Becky,"Oh, yeah, that. That happens sometimes. Old house, bad wiring... Or if you ask my crazy aunt Shirley, it's... haunted."
Becky,"Sweetie, really, it's just the wiring."
Eleven,"No."
Terry,"It's Mama. Sunflower. Rainbow. Three to the right. Four to the left."
Eleven,"I don't understand."
Terry,"Four-fifty. She knows I'm here."
Eleven,"She wants to talk."
Terry,"Rainbow."
Bob,"All right. All right. I'm 3.6 inches, what do you got?"
Mike,"I'm not sure. Mrs. Byers?"
Joyce,"Hold on."
Joyce,"Twenty-one feet, four inches."
Bob,"What about Tippecanoe to Danford Creek?"
Joyce,"Danford? Where's Danford?"
Bob,"Dining room."
Joyce,"Sixteen feet, ten inches."
Bob,"What about Danford to Jordan?"
Joyce,"Oh, come on. This has gotta be enough."
Bob,"It's not. It's... it's really not."
Joyce,"Okay. Can't you figure it out?"
Bob,"Well, it's hard. The ratio isn't exactly one-to-one. I mean, if you're twisting my arm, and you are twisting my arm, I would say that the X is... maybe a half mile southeast of Danford?"
Joyce,"Thank you. Thank you."
Bob,"What? Are we... we really going?"
Karen,"I don't know, Cath. Maybe if it was Margaret Thatcher, that'd be another story."
Karen,"Just a second, Cath."
Karen,"Ted, can you get that please?"
Ted,"Sorry."
Karen,"I got it."
Dustin,"Your line has been busy for over two hours, Mr. Wheeler. Do you realize this?"
Ted,"Oh, I do realize."
Dustin,"Is Mike home?"
Ted,"No."
Dustin,"No? Well, where the hell is he?"
Ted,"Karen, where's our son?"
Karen,"Will's!"
Dustin,"Will's. No one's picking up there. Nancy. What about Nancy?"
Ted,"Karen, where's Nancy?"
Karen,"Ally's!"
Ted,"Ally's. Our children don't live here anymore. You didn't know that?"
Dustin,"Seriously?"
Ted,"Am I done here?"
Dustin,"Son of a bitch. You're really no help at all, you know that?"
Ted,"Hey! Language."
Dustin,"Listen... I've been thinking... I love you. I'm sorry."
Steve,"I'm sorry? What the hell am I sorry for?"
Dustin,"Steve. Are those for Mr. or Mrs. Wheeler?"
Steve,"No."
Dustin,"Good. Nancy isn't home."
Steve,"Where is she?"
Dustin,"Doesn't matter. We have bigger problems than your love life. Do you still have that bat?"
Steve,"Bat? What bat?"
Dustin,"The one with the nails?"
Steve,"Why?"
Dustin,"I'll explain it on the way."
Steve,"Now?"
Dustin,"Now!"
Lucas,"And that was the last we ever saw of her. After that, she was just gone. I can't believe it's been that long. Feels like yesterday."
Max,"Yeah. I mean, I bet."
Lucas,"Wow. It's crazy."
Max,"I know. It's crazy, but... I really liked it."
Lucas,"Liked it?"
Max,"Yeah. Well, I mean, I had a few issues."
Lucas,"Issues?"
Max,"I felt it was a little derivative in parts."
Lucas,"What are you talking about?"
Max,"I just wish it had a little more originality. That's all."
Lucas,"You don't believe me?"
Max,"Lucas, come on, seriously? How gullible do you think I am?"
Lucas,"Why would I make this up?"
Max,"I don't know. To impress me or something? Or you're just, like, insane."
Lucas,"I tell you all of this. I mean, top-secret stuff. Risking my life. And this is how you react?"
Max,"Risking your life?"
Lucas,"Oh, so this is funny to you?"
Max,"Yeah. I mean... kind of funny. Stupid, but funny."
Lucas,"Where are you going?"
Max,"Story time's over, isn't it?"
Lucas,"What's wrong with you? I gave you what you wanted."
Max,"I wanted to be a part of the group, not a part of some joke."
Lucas,"It's not a joke."
Max,"You did a good job, okay? You can go tell the others I believed your lies if it gets you experience points or whatever."
Lucas,"We have a lot of rules in our party, but the most important is, 'Friends don't lie.' Never ever. No matter what."
Max,"Is that right?"
Lucas,"Then how do you explain this?"
Max,"I had to do that. To protect you."
Lucas,"To protect me from who, exactly?"
Max,"The big bad government baddies from Hawkins Lab?"
Lucas,"Lower your voice."
Max,"Maybe it was to protect me from the Demogorgon from another dimension?"
Lucas,"Max, I'm serious, shut up! Oh, no, no! You know what it was? It was Eleven. The girl..."
Max,"Stop talking."
Lucas,"You're going to get us killed. Do you understand?"
Max,"You're serious?"
Lucas,"I really wish I wasn't."
Max,"Prove it."
Lucas,"I can't."
Max,"So what? I'm supposed to just trust you?"
Lucas,"Yes."
Billy,"Shit. I gotta go. Um... Don't follow me out. Okay?"
Max,"Do you believe me?"
Billy,"The hell I tell you?"
Max,"I'm not late."
Billy,"You know what I'm talking about."
Max,"Oh, Lucas? So he has a name now, huh?"
Billy,"It's a small town, okay? We weren't hanging out."
Max,"Hmm. Well, you know what happens when you lie."
Billy,"I'm not lying."
Owens,"What if they try to replicate that? The more attention we bring to ourselves, the more people like the Hollands who know the truth, the more likely that scenario becomes. You see why I have to stop the truth from spreading, too. Just the same as those weeds there. By whatever means necessary."
Nancy,"So, is it enough?"
Jonathan,"The tape recording, is it enough? Is it incriminating?"
Murray,"What are you doing?"
Nancy,"Thinking."
Murray,"With vodka?"
Nancy,"It's a central nervous system depressant. So yes, with vodka."
Murray,"Music? Really?"
Nancy,"Yes. It helps me..."
Jonathan,"What? Think?"
Nancy,"How long is this gonna take?"
Murray,"Longer if you keep talking."
Nancy,"Is the tape incriminating or not? It's a simple question."
Murray,"There's nothing simple about it. Nothing simple about anything you've told me."
Nancy,"You don't believe us, do you?"
Murray,"I believe you, but that's not the problem. You don't need me to believe you. You need them to believe you."
Nancy,"Them?"
Murray,"Them. With a capital 'T.' Your priest, your postman, your teacher, the world at large. They won't believe any of this."
Nancy,"That's why we made the tape."
Murray,"Oh. That's easy to bury. Easy."
Nancy,"He admits it. You heard it. He admits culpability."
Murray,"You're being naive, Nancy! Those people... They're not wired like me and you, okay? They don't spend their lives trying to get a look at what's behind the curtain. They like the curtain. It provides them stability, comfort, definition. This... this would open the curtain, and open the curtain behind that curtain, okay? So the minute someone with an ounce of authority calls bullshit, everyone will nod their heads and say, 'See? Ha! I knew it! It was bullshit.' That is, if you even get their attention at all."
Nancy,"You're saying we did all of this for nothing?"
Murray,"I'm saying, I'm thinking."
Jonathan,"This is ridiculous."
Murray,"That's it. That's it! It's just too strong. Too strong. Better. Perfect. We water it down."
Nancy,"Precisely."
Jonathan,"Wait. What?"
Murray,"Your story. We moderate it. Just like this drink here. We make it more tolerable. Perhaps Barbara was exposed to some dangerous toxins. A leak from the lab. Like Three Mile Island or something. Something scary but familiar. Close enough that it hits the man right where it hurts. And those assholes that killed Barb... They'll go down."
Owens,"All right, what are we looking at?"
lab technician,"This was some of the soil we took yesterday."
Owens,"Okay. So what is your concern?"
lab technician,"Well, we didn't find any signs of contamination. Uh, nothing hazardous other than some pesticides."
Owens,"Well, it's a farm."
lab technician,"Right, right. Exactly. But..."
Becky,"Like this?"
Eleven,"Yes."
Becky,"It's okay if I sit here, right?"
Eleven,"Yes."
Becky,"And I won't mess it up or anything?"
Eleven,"No."
Becky,"Okay. If you talk to Terry, will you tell her that I love her very much? And that I'm sorry that I didn't believe..."
Eleven,"Stop talking."
Becky,"Okay, sorry."
Terry,"Breathe. Sunflower. Rainbow. Three to the right. Four to the left. Four-fifty. Breathe."
Eleven,"Mama?"
Terry,"Breathe. Sunflower. Rainbow. Three to the right. Four to the left. Four-fifty."
Eleven,"Mama, it's me... Jane. I'm here now."
Terry,"Breathe. Sunflower. Four-fifty. Breathe. Sunflower. Rainbow."
Eleven,"I'm home."
Terry,"No."
Eleven,"Mama!"
Terry,"Mama! Mama! Oh, my baby!"
Eleven,"What do I do? Mama, what do I do? Help me!"
Becky,"Breathe. Breathe. Just breathe. Breathe. Just breathe, all right? They're on their way. They're on their way, okay?"
Eleven,"Okay."
Becky,"Stay with us, darling. Stay with us."
Terry,"Hey, there. Jane? Where's Jane?"
Becky,"I'm sorry. I'm so sorry."
Terry,"No, I saw her."
Becky,"No, no, she wasn't breathing."
Terry,"She was crying. I heard it. He was there."
Becky,"Who was there?"
Terry,"He took her."
Becky,"Don't take it out! Terry!"
Terry,"No! No!"
Becky,"Please don't!"
Terry,"Three to the right. Four to the left."
Unknown,"Ma'am, can I see your badge?"
Terry,"Stay back. Stay back!"
Terry,"Jane? Jane? Jane... No! No! No! She's my child! No! She's my child!"
Terry,"No! No. No."
Terry,"Four-fifty."
Becky,"Breathe. They're on their way."
nurse,"Stay with us, darling."
Terry,"Sunflower. Three to the right. Four to the left. Rainbow. Four-fifty. Jane... No! Four-fifty. Breathe. Three to the right. Four to the left. Sunflower. Rainbow. Three to the right. Four to the left. Four-fifty. Sunflower. Rainbow."
Bob,"There's nothing. There's nothing here."
Joyce,"Are... Are we close?"
Bob,"We're in the vicinity."
Joyce,"What's that mean, the vicinity?"
Bob,"It means we're close. I don't know. It's not precise."
Joyce,"But we did all that work."
Bob,"I told you, the scale ratio is not exactly one-to-one. We needed to take..."
Will,"Turn right."
Joyce,"What?"
Will,"I saw him."
Joyce,"Where?"
Will,"Not here. In my now-memories."
Bob,"In your what?"
Will,"Turn right!"
Joyce,"Are you okay?"
Mike,"Superspy."
Bob,"What's Jim doing here? Joyce?"
Joyce,"Boys, I need you to stay here."
Mike,"No. Mom, Mom, Mom, it's not safe."
Joyce,"That's why I need you to stay here! Stay here!"
Joyce,"Hopper! Hey, be careful. Just going down the hole."
Bob,"Vines."
Joyce,"Give me that."
Bob,"The shovel?"
Joyce,"Yes, give me the shovel."
Joyce,"I need you to help me get down there."
Bob,"Joyce, what are you talking about?"
Joyce,"Bob! Now!"
Joyce,"Hopper! Hopper! Hopper!"
Bob,"Joyce, what is going on? Where are we?"
Joyce,"Bob, are you okay?"
Bob,"Tunnels. Is this Will's map? We're in Will's map. We're actually inside of Will's map. How did he know all this?"
Joyce,"Bob! Over here! It's his. He's gotta be this way."
Bob,"Come on."
Joyce,"Hopper! Do you see anything? I mean, in your now-memories?"
Joyce,"Hopper! Hopper! What? This is... Oh! It's his arm."
Bob,"It's choking him."
Joyce,"Knife?"
Bob,"It's over there."
Joyce,"Okay. Hands! Hands!"
Hopper,"Cut it..."
Joyce,"Oh, my God. Hopper, are you okay? Are you okay?"
Hopper,"Joyce. Hey, Bob."
Bob,"Hey, Jim."
Joyce,"Oh, God!"
Hopper,"Go! Go! Go! Clear the area!"
man,"Move, now!"
Mike,"Will? Will, you okay? Will, what's wrong?"
