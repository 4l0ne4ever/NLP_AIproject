Unknown,"Where is he?"
Jason,"Wha… Wait, what?"
Unknown,"Eddie. Where was Eddie when you saw this?"
Jason,"He… He was in the boat, like I said."
Powell,"Right."
Officer,"Right. Right."
Powell,"But then, uh… who lifted Patrick out the water?"
Jason,"What… You're not listening to me. Why aren't you listening to me?"
Powell,"Jason, we are listening."
Jason,"No, you're not. You're not. Eddie, he's… Eddie is a vessel. Just a vessel."
Powell,"A vessel?"
Jason,"For Satan. He's made a pact with the devil. Now he has his powers."
Jason,"You don't believe me."
Powell,"We're just, uh, processing all of this, that's all. Okay?"
Callahan,"Yeah."
Jason,"How do you expect to stop the devil if you don't believe he's real?"
Unknown,"I can make it stop. I can make the pain end. Where's the girl?"
Wallace,"I told you. I don't… I don't know."
Unknown,"There are two proposed explanations for what is happening. Explanation one, an invisible boogeyman from another dimension is slaughtering these kids. Explanation two, Dr. Brenner's special little pet has gone rogue again and he and his lackeys are now seeking to cover it up. Perhaps in the hopes of selling their pet to the Soviets. Now, which explanation sounds plausible to you?"
Wallace,"I don't know."
Unknown,"There's still a chance to redeem yourself, Mr. Wallace. Where is she?"
Brenner,"Do you know what happens when someone has a stroke? The blood supply to the brain is cut off. It scrambles the signals in the brain to the point where the mind can forget how to do things. To eat. To speak. To walk. When you were attacked last year, I believe that your signals were scrambled in much the same way. But just as a stroke victim can learn to walk again, I believe you, too, can return to your full power. Your abilities are still in here. You just need to remember. Everything that took place in my lab was captured on videotape. Every success and every failure. It's important for you to not just see your past, but to fully re-experience it. In doing so, I believe we can repair your broken signals. As we saw tonight, that process has already begun."
Eleven,"If this all happened, why don't I remember?"
Brenner,"Because you do not want to. Our brains have a defense mechanism in place to protect it from bad memories. From trauma. You buried these memories long ago."
Eleven,"Papa. When I was in there, I saw something. There was blood. So much blood."
Brenner,"That was another memory, a… a more powerful one, invading from your subconscious. You have demons, Eleven. You have demons in your past. That is why we must proceed carefully. One step at a time, one memory at a time. If we go too fast, I'm afraid you could become lost in the darkness. And if you are lost… So are we all."
Worker,"Hey, Eric. I'm taking five."
Eric,"You just took five."
Worker,"Yeah, well, tell Milo to take it easy on the onions next time."
Robin,"Not to be a wimp, but can I sit in the car? 'Cause this is gonna totally and royally suck."
Unknown,"It'll be fine."
Robin,"I can't stand to see those dull eyes of Eddie's break again. I really, really can't."
Unknown,"At least he can drink himself into feeling better."
Unknown,"That's what my mom does."
Robin,"Why don't we give it a trial? 'Hey, Eddie. Uh, good news first this time. We got you some Dustin-approved junk food and that six-pack you requested. Oh yeah, and we found Vecna. Bad news is that he's in that other, darker, much scarier dimension, and the gate's closed, so we have no way of getting to him. He's entirely shut off to us, so basically you're screwed. And, no, I know you were already screwed, but now you're doubly, triply screwed.'"
Unknown,"Wait. Maybe we don't put it like that."
Robin,"'We're one step closer to finding Vecna.' That's what we say. That's what's important."
Unknown,"See, Robin? Positive spin can make all the difference."
Robin,"Uh-huh."
Unknown,"Oh shit."
Powell,"Nothing to see. Just step back a little. As many of you know, the Roane County line received a call a little after midnight reporting a homicide here on the lake. Officer Callahan here and myself arrived first on the scene. We made our way to the shore of Lover's Lake, about ten yards from that house you see behind me. It was there that we found the victim, an 18-year-old senior from Hawkins High, Patrick McKinney. His limbs… His body, it was disfigured… There was an eyewitness on the scene… We have also identified a person of interest. Eddie Munson. We encourage anyone with information to please come forward. You've got a lot of questions, and I'm going to answer as many as I can. Two o'clock at town hall, where anyone from the Hawkins community is welcome. But right now, I've got work to do, and I appreciate your understanding."
Unknown,"Oh my God. What are we even doing? I mean, where is the FBI?"
Unknown,"That's what I want to know. We got a serial killer on the loose."
Unknown,"Oh man. This is not good. Really not good."
Reporter,"Is Eddie still in Hawkins?"
Eddie,"Dustin, can you hear me? Wheeler?"
Unknown,"Eddie. Holy shit. Are you okay?"
Eddie,"Nah, man. Pretty… Pretty goddamn far from okay."
Unknown,"Where is he?"
Dustin,"Where are you?"
Eddie,"Skull Rock. Do you know it?"
Dustin,"Uh, yeah. That's near Cornwallis and..."
Unknown,"Garrett, yeah. I know where that is."
Dustin,"Hold tight. We're coming. We're coming."
Argyle,"I can't feel my butt. Can't feel my butt. Can you guys feel your butts?"
Will,"I can feel my butt."
Jonathan,"Everyone needs to be on their best behavior, okay?"
Argyle,"Why are you looking at me when you say that?"
Jonathan,"I didn't."
Mike,"They're just really religious."
Argyle,"Yeah, and I'm super spiritual, dude."
Mike,"Yeah, I think they're spiritual too. Just in a different way."
Mike,"Oh. Hey. Is Suzie here?"
Child,"Away, you starveling! You elf-skin! You dried neat's tongue!"
Argyle,"This is my kind of party."
Unknown,"I've been bitten. Help! Help!"
Jonathan,"Beautiful performance. Excuse me. Uh, hey, we're looking for Suzie."
Director,"Can you not see that we are filming?"
Unknown,"Come on. All right, stay in it, Tabitha. Stay in it."
Mike,"Hi, we're looking for Suzie."
Unknown,"Don't know, don't care. That's too much salt, Peter. Father's kidneys! Father's kidneys!"
Woman,"Cornelius! How many times do I have to tell you? That is not a toy."
Unknown,"Come on."
Cornelius,"You make another escape, I'm getting Father."
Unknown,"Who the hell are you?"
Argyle,"Argyle. Uh, and you are?"
Eden,"Eden. Like the garden."
Jonathan,"Wow. We're looking for Suzie. Do you know where she is?"
Eden,"Third floor, second door on your left. You make sure to give that selfish four-eyed shit a nice little shove for me."
Argyle,"Absolutely. Eden, I… I will shove her for you. I will… I will do anything for you."
Unknown,"Well, great, she's not here."
Mike,"Suzie!"
Suzie,"Yeah? Who the heck are you? And what are you doing in my room?"
Mike,"Sorry, that's… that's fair. No, listen. We're Dustin's friends."
Mike,"Yeah. We really need your help."
Murray,"You said an hour."
Murray,"I underestimated."
Joyce,"I thought you were dead."
Murray,"Might as well be. We are truly in hell if hell froze over."
Murray,"There's nothing south, but two miles north I saw some smoke. Could be a town, a house. Maybe somebody there knows where we can find this prison."
Joyce,"The top-secret prison."
Murray,"Really? Right. Any luck with our friend?"
Joyce,"What do you think?"
Murray,"Hey! Dipshit!"
Joyce,"We're outta here. Last chance. Where's the prison?"
Yuri,"I told you. Yuri will help you for the right price."
Joyce,"I told you, we're wasting our time."
Murray,"Half."
Joyce,"What?"
Murray,"What? You heard me, you stubborn bastard. Half the reward. Twenty thousand."
Yuri,"Thirty thousand."
Murray,"Twenty-two."
Yuri,"Twenty-five."
Murray,"All right."
Yuri,"Looks like we got ourselves a moron! You thought I was serious? He thought I was serious. I got you! I got you good!"
Murray,"There's only one thing you get if you take this deal. You get to live."
Yuri,"You are not killer."
Murray,"Oh, you're right. He's not a killer. No. Thing is, we don't need to kill you. We can just leave you here. Because there's nothing for miles and no one will find you."
Murray,"No human, at least. I saw tracks. In the woods, Yuri. Bears."
Joyce,"Bears. Who knew you could see your own future? Shall we fly out of here, little bird?"
Yuri,"Uh, da, da."
Murray,"Bye-bye, Yuri."
Yuri,"Wait. You should go east, not north. My warehouse is there. Supplies, guns, truck. We will need to reach prison by nightfall if you hope to save your friend. That is, if he's not already dead."
Guard,"Out. Everyone out. Let's go! Move it!"
Guard,"What are you all waiting for? Move! Let's go! Move!"
Guard,"Am I dreaming, American? Or is this real?"
Guard,"What is wrong with your American friend?"
Antonov,"He has lost his spirit to live. And he is not my friend."
Antonov,"Isn't that right, Cursed One? You have lost your spirit to live."
Hopper,"Yeah. Yeah, something like that."
Antonov,"He is American after all. Big talk, but weak inside. Tell him to eat. Or he endangers us all. We have a big fight ahead of us."
Hopper,"What are you talking about? Fight?"
Antonov,"I have been in this place one week. My first night, I saw six men enter this room. Six. Just like us. They came out happy and fat, faces smothered in grease. But when night fell, they were thrown into that pit out there. But not alone. You heard those roars, yes? That is a monster. Not from this world. Thirty seconds it took! Thirty seconds... And all six men…"
Hopper,"You speak no sense. If they plan to kill us tonight, why waste this food on us?"
Antonov,"They want us strong. So we can fight it. To test its strength. To train this monster for war. But last week, the men got their weapons then scattered like fools. We stick together... Perhaps we stand a chance! Perhaps we live to see another day."
All,"Till tomorrow!"
Hopper,"Let me guess. This… it’s about nine feet tall? Thin, white skin? No face? No eyes?"
Antonov,"How do you know this?"
Hopper,"'Cause I've seen one. And I've fought one. And all your theories about it, they're all wrong. You know why they feed captive predators live prey? Because if they don't, the predator gets bored and it stops eating. It needs the thrill of the hunt. We're not here to train this monster with swords and axes. We're here to entertain it. And this food… This food isn't to make us strong. It's to, uh, make us plump. So we're full of the nutrients and protein that a growing monster might need. So eat up, boys. Enjoy. This is your last meal."
Unknown,"Which number are you aiming for?"
Eleven,"Three."
Orderly,"You know, sometimes it’s helpful to take a step away for a moment. Let the mind clear."
Orderly,"Determined, aren't we? You know… you remind me of someone. Someone I used to know really well. Can you guess who that is?"
Eleven,"One?"
Orderly,"Papa said that he doesn't... Exist? I know. But can I tell you a secret? Sometimes, Papa doesn't tell the truth."
Orderly,"He'd found his strength in a memory from his past. Something that made him sad, but also angry. Do you have a memory like that?"
Eleven,"Jane. No! No!"
Brenner,"Well, well. It looks like we have a new winner."
Yuri,"I present you… Kyrzran. You see that gray steeple over there? That is Yuri's warehouse."
Joyce,"Looks like a church."
Yuri,"Let's see what miracles it holds, yes? Oh. Someone has been in my peanut butter. Very popular, as I say, eh?"
Murray,"Weapons. Where are the weapons?"
Joyce,"Oh Jesus."
Yuri,"Hey. Not in a church. You like all this? Wait until you see my flamethrower."
Murray,"We don't have time for show-and-tell. We need to get going."
Yuri,"She's always this bossy?"
Murray,"You heard her. Keys, map. Let's go."
Yuri,"So, prison is here. Between these two mountains. Approximately two-hour drive."
Murray,"I don't see anything."
Yuri,"Because it's not on the map, but it is there."
Murray,"How do we know you're not leading us into some trap?"
Yuri,"Because I do not need to. You want to break into deadliest prison in all motherland. It is suicide."
Murray,"Who said anything about breaking in?"
Yuri,"Oh. You just expect to knock? 'Oh hello, let me in. I'm friendly American with a big beard.'"
Murray,"Something like that, actually, yes. You were planning to turn us over to the warden. Today, if I'm not mistaken."
Yuri,"Ah, I see now. I bring you in as prisoners and then set you free inside walls. It is risky, crazy, you will still probably die, yet I like it. But for this to work, Yuri cannot be tied. Hey, it's hard to turn over prisoners when I'm a prisoner myself. Hey, I think the warden might find that suspicious."
Murray,"Which is why, from here on out, you're gonna be Murray. And I'm gonna be Yuri."
Yuri,"I don't follow."
Murray,"Don't worry. It's a silent role."
Antonov,"You want to make a fool of yourself, go ahead. But to bring down these men, leaving them with no hope, what is the purpose of that?"
Hopper,"I tell them truth. You feed their delusion."
Antonov,"Not delusions. Hope. I believe we can fight. I believe we can win. I have a son, Mikhail. I cannot leave this world with him believing his father is a traitor. I need to get back to him, and I will get back to him."
Hopper,"Is he slow?"
Antonov,"What?"
Hopper,"Mikhail, your son. Is… Is he slow? Is he stupid?"
Antonov,"Stop talking."
Hopper,"No, he's very smart. Top of his class."
Antonov,"Be silent!"
Hopper,"Then you're not his father."
Antonov,"I said go!"
Hopper,"You are drunk, American. I would stop speaking unless you wish to die sooner."
Hopper,"I can. It doesn't matter. I know I'm gonna die today. But guess what? I know who I am and what I've done, unlike you and these men, who can't face the truth. That you're the reason why we're in here. You're gonna die. Your son is not your son… and your wife..."
Antonov,"I said to be silent!"
Antonov,"You do that again... we shoot you on the spot."
Hopper,"Fools. You happy now, American? Was that worth it? Was that worth it?"
Hopper,"We call it a Demogorgon. I don't know how they got it here or what they're doing with it, but… Everything I said about it's true. Except it has one weakness. Fire. Hates fire. So I figure, if we want a shot at killing this thing, we need some fuel. And I need something to light it with. So you asked me if it was worth it? To answer your question… yeah, I think it was worth it."
Antonov,"You son of a bitch. You son of a bitch. Don't make me laugh. My ribs are broken. Don't make me laugh."
Woman,"Cornelius? Cornelius?"
Cornelius,"Cornelius!"
Jonathan,"Wait, where's Argyle?"
Mike,"Shit, I don't know."
Suzie,"And three, two… Oh my God. Way to go, Cornelius. Away, you mouldy rogue! Away! And we're in."
Mike,"Holy sh… heck. Oh holy heck. You did it."
Suzie,"Hold your applause. I don't see an address."
Mike,"'Office.' Try 'office.'"
Suzie,"What is all this? Maybe it's hidden in the code?"
Mike,"What you just said makes no sense."
Suzie,"Hold your butts. I'll trace the IP."
Mike,"The… The I-what?"
Suzie,"The internet protocol address. It's a unique numerical label given to all information technology connected to the Internet. What's the Internet? Don't worry about it. It's just gonna change the world."
Mike,"What's happening now?"
Suzie,"I'm running the IP through a geolocation software. Basically a form of data mining."
Director,"Incredible. Just incredible. And, Father, your terror. It looked genuine."
Suzie,"Bingo."
All,"Nevada?"
Mike,"Can you print this?"
Suzie,"No, my skills end at IP geolocation."
Mike,"You were being sarcastic."
Suzie,"Yeah."
Father,"These kids are gonna drive me to the loony bin."
Eden,"Hi, Father. You look like you need a nap."
Mike,"Slow down!"
Mike,"Dustin's right. You're a certified genius."
Argyle,"I think we just spooked a skunk."
Argyle,"Yo. My dudes. Any luck?"
Powell,"You see that, Chief? Openly mocking us."
Officer,"Stay calm. Stay calm."
Powell,"A bunch of angry, armed vigilantes are out hunting kids, openly defying us, and you want me to stay calm. Stay calm. Yeah."
Officer,"Hey, Chief, you copy?"
Powell,"Yeah, I copy."
Officer,"Found their station wagon hidden up by Skull Rock. No sign of them though."
Powell,"Skull Rock? Yeah. Isn't that a make-out spot?"
Officer,"And a stone's throw from Lover's Lake."
Powell,"The hell they wanna go back there for? One way to find out. Hold tight. On our way."
Nancy,"Something's happening."
Dustin,"Dustin? Can you slow down? Dustin? I think we're getting close. Watch your step, big guy."
Steve,"Oh man. You gotta be shitting me."
Robin,"Yeah. Lover's Lake."
Dustin,"This is confounding. There's a gate in Lover's Lake?"
Nancy,"Whenever the Demogorgon attacked, it always left an opening."
Robin,"Maybe Vecna's the same way."
Steve,"Yeah, only one way to find out."
Eddie,"Easy. I… I said easy, man."
Eddie,"Sorry, dude. Here you go."
Steve,"Yeah, I'm just gonna do that. Thank you."
Eddie,"Yeah, that works too."
Steve,"Good, you got her."
Nancy,"Wheeler. Thanks."
Dustin,"Hey, hey, hey, you trying to sink us? This thing holds three people tops, okay?"
Nancy,"It's better this way, okay? You guys stay here with Max. Keep an eye out for trouble."
Dustin,"You keep an eye out. It's my goddamn theory."
Nancy,"You heard Nance."
Dustin,"Who put her in charge?"
Nancy,"I did."
Dustin,"Compass."
Nancy,"Hey, there you go."
Dustin,"Ow. You said three."
Nancy,"Sorry."
Dustin,"Bedtime at nine, kiddos. Miss you already!"
Boy,"Please! Please, please…"
Two,"You shouldn't be wandering the halls. And not safe. You shamed me today."
Eleven,"I'm sorry. I didn't wanna hurt you."
Two,"You are weak and pathetic. I was holding back. And then you do that before everyone? Before Papa?"
Eleven,"No."
Two,"How'd that feel? Did you like that?"
Girl,"Aw, feeling a little dizzy there? Poor baby."
Brenner,"What have you done? What have you done?"
Owens,"Okay, easy. Deep breaths. Take deep breaths. You did well, Eleven. You did very well."
Eleven,"I know what happened now. I killed them, didn't I, Papa? I killed them all."
Owens,"Okay. Shh."
Robin,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, slow down. Slow down, guys."
Nancy,"They're stopping. What are they stopping for?"
Dustin,"Guys, what's going on? Come on, talk to me. What's going on?"
Robin,"Uh, Dustin, your compass has gone from wonky to wonky with a capital 'aah!'"
Nancy,"Steve, what are you doing?"
Steve,"Somebody's gotta go down and check this out. Unless one of you three can top being a Hawkins High swim co-captain and a certified lifeguard for three years, then… It's gotta be me. No complaints, all right?"
Robin,"Hey, I'm not complaining. I do not wanna go down there."
Lucas,"Ugh. When'd Steve get so hairy?"
Max,"Right? I keep telling him he needs to tame that jungle, but he claims the ladies dig it."
Lucas,"Let me see."
Max,"What?"
Robin,"Hey. Good luck."
Steve,"Thanks."
Nancy,"Steve? Be careful."
Dustin,"You guys realize, if there's a gate down there, it's technically a water gate."
Robin,"Watergate."
Eddie,"Where we at, Wheeler?"
Nancy,"Closing in on a minute."
Robin,"Okay. Come on, Steve. Come on."
Officer,"Down by the water! It was on this shoreline."
Steve,"I found it. I found it. Yeah. I found it."
Nancy,"You found it?"
Dustin,"Dustin, you are a goddamn Einstein. Steve found the gate..."
Max,"Cops. Shit, shit, shit."
Lucas,"We can't let 'em find Eddie."
Max,"Stay with me. Hey, officers! Over here! I found the killer! This way!"
Dustin,"Shit. Go!"
Steve,"It's pretty wild. It's more a snack-size gate than the mama gate, but still, it's pretty damn big."
Nancy,"Steve! Steve!"
Eddie,"No! No! What the hell was that, man?"
Nancy,"Nancy, really, what happened?"
Eddie,"Jesus!"
Robin,"Wait, wait, wait. You're not going in there, are you?"
Nancy,"Just wait here."
Robin,"No, Nancy!"
Eddie,"Goddamn it!"
Dustin,"Dustin! Shit."
Robin,"Hey there. No, no, no, no, no, no. What are you doing? She said wait."
Eddie,"Yeah, I heard her."
Robin,"She's in charge."
Eddie,"Are you kidding me? I made that shit up."
Robin,"Don't you go. Don't you..."
Eddie,"Goddamn it… Son of a bitch! Oh, this is so stupid. This is so stupid. This is so stupid. Shit! Shit! Shit!"
