Unknown,"One for each of you. Thanks."
Unknown,"Have fun."
Unknown,"There you go. Yeah!"
Unknown,"Now, doesn't that just lift your spirits?"
Unknown,"Let's give another big hand for the Hawkins High Marching Band!"
Larry,"I hope you're all having a good time tonight. Are you having a good time? I can't hear you! Are you having a good time? I want you to know that we spared no expense to provide you with the very best entertainment that money can buy! But enough of me blabbering. Who here wants to see some fireworks? Come on, now, you can do better than that. Who here wants to see some fireworks?"
Unknown,"Keep your arms inside."
Unknown,"Uh-oh! Dad can't get out now."
Unknown,"Why do you two enjoy torturing me?"
Unknown,"Because it's fun. Yeah, Dad, 'cause it's fun!"
Ted,"Oh, boy."
Unknown,"Hoo!"
Karen,"Happy Fourth of July! That was pretty, wasn't it? Yeah. That was a big one, wasn't it?"
Unknown,"Mom, the trees. The trees are moving."
Karen,"What, baby? Why are you looking at the trees, baby? The fireworks. Look at the fireworks!"
Eleven,"He said he was building something. That it was all for me."
Unknown,"Building something... Is he talking about the flayed?"
Unknown,"He must be."
Unknown,"So, he's building an army, just like we thought."
Unknown,"Yeah, but he's not building this army to spread. He's building it to stop Eleven."
Unknown,"Last year, El closed the gate on him. I have a feeling that really pissed him off."
Unknown,"Like, royally."
Unknown,"And the Mind Flayer now knows that she's the only thing that can stop him."
Unknown,"But if she's out of the way... Game over."
Eleven,"He also said he was gonna kill all of you."
Unknown,"Yeah, well, that's nice."
Nancy,"Do you guys hear that? It's just the fireworks."
Unknown,"Billy... When he told you this, it was here, in this room?"
Unknown,"He knows we're here."
Unknown,"Jesus, slow down!"
Unknown,"Yeah, what is this, like, the Indy 500?"
Steve,"It's the Indy 300."
Robin,"No, dingus, it's 500!"
Steve,"It's 300! Let's say a million."
Unknown,"What is wrong with them?"
Erica,"I don't know."
Dustin,"Dustin, watch out! Shit!"
Unknown,"You guys all right back there?"
Dustin,"They're fine."
Unknown,"Come on. We gotta go, now. Come on! Get out! Let's go!"
Steve,"Ow! We're coming! This sucks."
Robin,"Okay, okay, okay! Woo! Why are we running?"
Mike,"Yeah. That's good like that."
Unknown,"Hey, get away from the windows."
Unknown,"It's close."
Unknown,"Where'd it go?"
Max,"Holy shit."
Unknown,"Go, go, go! Everybody out! Hurry up! Come on! Drive! Drive!"
Steve,"Whoa! Where are we going?"
Unknown,"Just trust me."
Dustin,"All clear."
Marty,"Doc! What did I tell you?! Eighty-eight miles per hour!"
Doc,"The temporal displacement occurred exactly 1:20... The appropriate question is 'When the hell are they?' You see, Einstein has just become the world's first time traveler! I sent him... into the future!"
Unknown,"You two, sit."
Steve,"No, no, no! These seats are too close!"
Dustin,"Dude, these seats blow."
Robin,"Then don't watch the movie."
Steve,"We wanna watch it."
Dustin,"Then watch it!"
Unknown,"Sorry."
Dustin,"Whatever you do, don't... go... anywhere."
Steve,"Fine, Dad."
Dustin,"Okay, it's official. I'm never having kids."
Erica,"What are we doing here?"
Dustin,"We're laying low. Cooling off."
Erica,"Like Oswald."
Dustin,"Oswald was found in a theater and shot to death."
Erica,"A week later."
Dustin,"The point is, his plan didn't work."
Erica,"Only because it was a setup."
Dustin,"What?"
Erica,"He was just a patsy."
Dustin,"Tell me you're joking."
Erica,"We need to get outta here."
Dustin,"All right, you watch Tweedledee and Tweedledum. Make sure they don't go anywhere."
Erica,"Where are you going?"
Dustin,"To find us a ride."
Marty,"Are you telling me that you built a time machine..."
Unknown,"What's he saying?"
Murray,"He's showing me the location of the key to turn off the machine."
Unknown,"Sorry, 'keys.' Two keys."
Murray,"Two-man rule."
Unknown,"Two-man rule?"
Murray,"Yeah, two men, two keys, like a... nuclear launch."
Unknown,"But, uh, to retrieve the keys, there is a vault."
Murray,"And to open the vault, you need to enter Planck's constant."
Hopper,"Planck's what?"
Murray,"Planck's constant. It's a very famous number."
Hopper,"All right, so we get the keys, and then we turn the machine off."
Murray,"That's what he says."
Joyce,"All right, well, that shouldn't be too hard. We can do this."
Hopper,"Joyce, did you hear the part where he said the place was like an impenetrable fortress?"
Joyce,"Yeah, but there has to be a way in."
Hopper,"Yeah, there is. Our military. Who are coming."
Joyce,"Well, we don't know that anymore because you yelled at them like it was a parent-teacher conference, and then you hung up on them, so we don't know what the hell's going on, because now we're... Wait, wait, what are we do... Oh!"
Hopper,"Wait, that's right! We're on our way to rescue our children from the big, bad Fourth of July celebration!"
Joyce,"You know what, if you can't handle this, then just turn around and drop me off first."
Hopper,"What are you gonna do? You gonna walk back to Hawkins?"
Joyce,"I will do anything if it gets me away from you!"
Hopper,"Children! Children! Children!"
Murray,"This interminable bickering was amusing at first, but it's getting very stale and we've still got a long drive ahead of us. So, why don't you two cut the horseshit and get to the part where you admit your sexual feelings for one another?"
Hopper,"Whoa!"
Joyce,"You are way off base, buddy!"
Murray,"Oh, spare me, spare me, spare me! Yes, yes, he's a brute. I know. Probably reminds you of a bad relationship, and, gosh, you'd really like a nice man to settle down with, but, admit it, you're real curious to know what he's like in the sack. And you. Ha! Well, you're just a big manbaby who'd rather act tough than show his true feelings, because the last time you opened your heart, you got hurt. Owie. And now, rather than admit these feelings, you're dancing around one another with this mind-numbing and frankly boorish mating ritual. So, please, for my sake, either quit your bickering, or pull over, tear off those clothes, and get it over with already!"
Alexei,"What was that?"
Murray,"I told them they should have sex."
Alexei,"They have not had sex?"
Murray,"No."
Unknown,"Okay, get her down."
Nancy,"Lemme see. Oh, shit."
Unknown,"What... What... Hey, what are you doing?"
Nancy,"I'm cleaning the wound."
Max,"No, first, we need to stop the bleeding, then clean, then disinfect, then bandage. I skateboard. Trust me."
Max,"Mike, hold this. Keep the pressure on it, nice and firm, okay? We're gonna need water, soap."
Unknown,"Does any of this help?"
Max,"No. Go get me a washcloth and a bowl."
Lucas,"A bowl?"
Max,"Lucas. Go."
Nancy,"What did that thing look like to you?"
Unknown,"Like that thing in the hospital, only bigger."
Unknown,"Yeah, a lot bigger."
Jonathan,"Like, Tom and Bruce, they merged to become one, right?"
Nancy,"And... And Driscoll kept saying how she needed to go back to the source..."
Unknown,"Wait, you think Driscoll's in there?"
Nancy,"Maybe. And... And... And maybe Heather and Janet, too, and God knows who else."
Jonathan,"I don't know how we're gonna kill this thing, but if we do..."
Nancy,"We kill all the flayed."
Jonathan,"And... we end this."
Nancy,"Maybe."
Jonathan,"All I know is... we need El."
Lucas,"Bowl... Bowl... Bowl... Why wouldn't it be with the cereal?"
Unknown,"I don't know."
Lucas,"What else do you use a bowl for?"
Unknown,"I... I don't know."
Lucas,"Oh, shit. Satan's Baby. You ever shot one of these suckers?"
Unknown,"No. Is it sweet?"
Lucas,"That's an understatement."
Max,"That doesn't look like a bowl."
Lucas,"Nah, it's way better. There is a reason this warning label says '18 or older.' This sucker is filled with 150 grains of black powder. AKA gunpowder. Strap two of these together, and it's bigger than an M-80. Five of them, we've got ourselves a stick of dynamite."
Max,"You wanna kill that thing with fireworks?"
Lucas,"Do you have a better idea?"
Max,"Uh, yeah. Eleven."
Lucas,"Against that thing? She's gonna need some backup."
Mike,"Does that hurt?"
Eleven,"Uh, not bad."
Mike,"You're gonna have an awesome scar. You'll look even more badass."
Eleven,"Bitchin'."
Mike,"Yeah, bitchin'. El... I've been meaning to tell you something. I..."
Max,"Ridiculous."
Lucas,"Will? We're gonna prove 'em wrong, right?"
Steve,"The ceiling stopped spinning for me. Is it still spinning for you?"
Robin,"Holy shit. No. You think we puked it all up?"
Steve,"Maybe. Ask me something. Interrogate me."
Robin,"Okay. Interrogate you. Sure. Um... When was the last time you, uh, peed your pants?"
Steve,"Today. When the Russian doctor took out the bone saw."
Robin,"Oh, my God. It was just a little bit, though."
Unknown,"Yeah, it's definitely still in her system."
Steve,"All right, my turn."
Robin,"Okay. Hit me."
Steve,"Have you... ever been in love?"
Robin,"Yep. Nancy Wheeler. First semester, senior year."
Steve,"Oh, my God. She's such a priss."
Robin,"Turns out, not really."
Steve,"Are you still in love with Nancy?"
Robin,"No."
Steve,"Why not?"
Robin,"I think it's because I found someone who's a little bit better for me. It's crazy. Ever since Dustin got home, he's been saying, 'You know, you gotta find your Suzie. You gotta find your Suzie.'"
Steve,"Wait, who's Suzie?"
Robin,"It's some girl from camp, I guess his girlfriend. To be honest with you, I'm not 100% sure she's even real."
Steve,"But that's not... that's not really the point. That doesn't matter. The point is, this girl, you know, the one that I like, it's somebody that I... didn't even talk to in school. And I don't even know why. Maybe 'cause Tommy H. would've made fun of me or... I wouldn't be... prom king. It's stupid. I mean, Dustin's right, it's all just a bunch of bullshit anyways. Because, when I think about it, I should've been hanging out with this girl the whole time. First of all, she's hilarious. She's so funny. I feel like, this summer, I have laughed harder than I have laughed... in a really long time. And she's smart. Way smarter than me. You know, she can crack, like, top secret Russian codes and... You know? She's honestly unlike anyone I've ever even met before."
Steve,"Robin? Robin, did you just OD in there?"
Robin,"No. I... am still alive."
Steve,"The floor's disgusting."
Robin,"Yeah, well, I already got a bunch of blood and puke on my shirt, so... What do you think?"
Steve,"About?"
Robin,"This girl."
Steve,"She sounds awesome."
Robin,"She is awesome. And what about the guy?"
Steve,"I think he's on drugs, and he's not thinking straight."
Robin,"Really? 'Cause I think he's thinking a lot more clearly than usual."
Steve,"He's not. Look... he doesn't even know this girl. And if he did know her, like... like really know her, I don't think he'd even want to be her friend."
Robin,"No, that's not true. No way is that true."
Steve,"Listen to me, Steve. It's shocked me to my core, but I like you. I really like you. But I'm not like your other friends. And I'm not like Nancy Wheeler."
Robin,"Robin, that's exactly why I like you."
Steve,"Do you remember what I said about Click's class? About me being jealous and, like, obsessed?"
Robin,"Yeah."
Steve,"It isn't because I had a crush on you. It's because... she wouldn't stop staring at you."
Robin,"Mrs. Click?"
Steve,"Tammy Thompson. I wanted her to look at me. But... she couldn't pull her eyes away from you and your stupid hair. And I didn't understand, because you would get bagel crumbs all over the floor. And you asked dumb questions. And you were a douchebag. And... And you didn't even like her and... I would go home... and just scream into my pillow."
Robin,"But Tammy Thompson's a girl."
Steve,"Steve."
Robin,"Yeah?"
Steve,"Oh. Holy shit."
Robin,"Yeah. Holy shit."
Steve,"Steve... did you OD over there?"
Robin,"No, I just, uh... just thinking."
Steve,"Okay. I mean, yeah. Tammy Thompson, you know, she's cute and all, but... I mean, she's a total dud."
Robin,"She is not."
Steve,"Yes, she is. She wants to be, like, a singer. She wants to move to, like, Nashville and shit."
Robin,"She has dreams."
Steve,"She can't even hold a tune. She's practically tone-deaf. Have you heard her? All the time."
Robin,"She does not sound like that."
Steve,"She sounds exactly... That's a great impersonation of her. She does not. You sound like a Muppet."
Robin,"She sounds like a Muppet."
Steve,"She sounds like a Muppet giving birth."
Unknown,"What the hell?"
Alexei,"And why all this? If I just turn the keys, it's like turning off a car. But then the car still works, does it not?"
Murray,"Yes."
Alexei,"And do you want the car to still work or do you want it to explode?"
Murray,"I want the car to explode."
Alexei,"Good. Then do this. Just make sure you are nowhere near it when it does. It is not pretty. Turns people into dust."
Murray,"And then... It's over."
Alexei,"And I become an American citizen and join in the fun, yes?"
Murray,"Who said you had to be an American to join the fun? It doesn't get more American than this, my friend. Fatty foods, ugly decadence, rigged games... Fifteen tickets, please."
Alexei,"They are rigged, these games?"
Murray,"Yes."
Alexei,"They do not look rigged."
Murray,"That's just it, my dear Alexei. They have been designed to present the illusion of fairness! But it's all a scam, a trick, to put your money in the rich man's pocket. That, my dear friend, is... America. But, hey... knock yourself out."
Alexei,"Where are you going?"
Murray,"To get us the closest thing to food I can find."
Joyce,"Hey. Hey. Karen."
Karen,"...feel the wind push you back and it's gonna... Joyce! Oh, my gosh! How funny to see you here! Where are the kids?"
Joyce,"I... I haven't seen them. I don't think they're here yet."
Karen,"Oh, my gosh, I can hardly keep track these days. Uh, they were at, uh... Dustin's, then Lucas's, then Max's. You know how it is. Summer! Probably getting into some kinda trouble."
Ted,"Hold on. Do we have seat belts?"
Unknown,"You three, up against the wall!"
Joyce,"No, where are they?"
Unknown,"Last warning, you two. Up against the wall! Hold the ride! On your life, Magnum."
Ted,"Woo! Here we go! Holy smokes!"
Doc,"Roads? Where we're going, we don't need roads."
Dustin,"And... blend."
Unknown,"It is so good!"
Dustin,"Well, shit, that worked."
Erica,"Course it worked. We just have to get on the bus with the rest of these plebes, and home sweet home, here we come."
Dustin,"Uh, Dustin?"
Erica,"What?"
Dustin,"Yeah, we might not wanna go to your house."
Erica,"Why?"
Dustin,"Well, I might've told them your full name."
Erica,"What is wrong with you?"
Dustin,"Dude, I was drugged."
Erica,"So?"
Dustin,"So, you resist. You tough it out. You tough it out like a man."
Erica,"Oh, yeah, it's easy for you to say."
Robin,"Guys?"
Unknown,"Sorry for the inconvenience. Have a pleasant evening."
Dustin,"Abort. Abort."
Steve,"Shit."
Robin,"Okay."
Steve,"Come on, let's go, let's go."
Unknown,"That's three green! And here's dart number four!"
Unknown,"One more for the big prize! You can do it, mister!"
Unknown,"We have a winner!"
Alexei,"Look! It's not rigged!"
Murray,"It's not rigged."
Unknown,"Traitor."
Murray,"Alexei! Alexei! Oh, no. Oh, my God. Let's go."
Alexei,"Easy."
Murray,"Keep pressure on it. I'll get you help. I'll get help."
Joyce,"Jim... Jim. Jim! They got Alexei, Jim! Jim! Alexei! They got Alexei, Jim!"
Hopper,"We gotta go. We gotta go. Let's go."
Unknown,"They make an odd couple, don't they?"
Unknown,"Well, it's like they say, there's someone for everyone."
Unknown,"Who wants a hot dog?"
Hopper,"Find Murray, get the car, bring it around back."
Joyce,"Okay."
Unknown,"Heading to 'Big Top.' Northeast side of the fair."
Unknown,"Hey! Get your kids outta here! Police! Get 'em out of here! Go!"
Unknown,"You, sir! Step on up! I see you eyeing the maze! Don't be surprised! Don't be scared! Step on up, sir!"
Unknown,"Do you dare enter the cave of horrors? You never know what you might find around the corner. Don't show your fear in the presence of the tiger. Or you may never escape this cave alive."
Murray,"Alexei! Oh, my God. I... I just left for a minute... for a corn dog. A stupid corn dog."
Joyce,"Oh, God. Oh, no."
Hopper,"Hit it. Hit it! Go! Go!"
Murray,"Alexei?"
Unknown,"On the lower level..."
Hopper,"Hey, translate."
Murray,"We've found the children. They are still in the mall. Lower level."
Unknown,"Keep all entrances locked down. I repeat... Keep all entrances locked down."
Unknown,"Everyone, get over here. I found them."
Lucas,"What are you doing here?"
Steve,"Ask them. It's their fault."
Robin,"True, yeah. Totally true. It's absolutely our fault."
Lucas,"I don't understand what happened to that car."
Dustin,"El has superpowers."
Robin,"I'm sorry?"
Steve,"Superpowers. She threw it with her mind. C'mon, catch up."
Erica,"That's El?"
Nancy,"Who's El?"
Robin,"I'm Robin. I work with Steve."
Dustin,"She cracked the top secret code."
Steve,"Yeah, which is how we found out about the Russians."
Lucas,"Russians? Wait, what Russians?"
Dustin,"The Russians!"
Max,"Those were Russians?"
Erica,"Some of them."
Lucas,"What are you talking about?"
Dustin,"Didn't you hear our code red?"
Lucas,"Yeah. Couldn't understand what you were saying."
Dustin,"Goddamn low battery."
Steve,"How many times do I have to tell you with the low battery?"
Dustin,"Well, everything worked out, didn't it?"
Erica,"Worked out? We almost died."
Steve,"Yeah, but we didn't, did we?"
Dustin,"It was pretty damn close."
Lucas,"Okay, Russians? As in, they're working for the Russian government?"
Dustin,"What are you not comprehending? Am I not speaking English? We have a full-blown Red Dawn situation."
Max,"So this has nothing to do with the gate?"
Dustin,"It has everything to do with the gate..."
Eleven,"My leg. My leg."
Mike,"Her leg, her leg. Okay."
Mike,"El! El! El, are you okay? El! El!"
