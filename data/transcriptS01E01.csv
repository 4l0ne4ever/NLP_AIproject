Mike, "It is almost here."
Dustin, "What is it?"
Lucas, "What if it's the Demogorgon?"
Lucas, "Oh, Jesus, we're so screwed if it's the Demogorgon."
Mike, "It's not the Demogorgon."

Mike, "Mom, wait, just 20 more minutes!"
Karen, "It's a school night, Michael."
Karen, "I just put Holly to bed. You can finish next weekend."
Mike, "But that'll ruin the flow!"
Karen, "Michael..."
Mike, "I'm serious, Mom."
Mike, "The campaign took two weeks to plan."
Mike, "How was I supposed to know it was gonna take ten hours?"
Karen, "You've been playing for ten hours?"
Mike, "Dad, don't you think that 20 more..."
Ted, "I think you should listen to your mother."
Will, "Oh, I got it!"

Dustin, "Yeah, she's turning into a real jerk."
Mike, "She's always been a real jerk."
Dustin, "Nuh-uh, she used to be cool."
Dustin, "Like that time she dressed up as an elf for our Elder tree campaign."
Mike, "Four years ago!"
Dustin, "Just saying."
Lucas, "Later."
Will, "It was a seven."
Mike, "Huh?"

Hopper, "Why don't you give me his number?"
Joyce, "You know, Hopper, he has nothing to do with this. Trust me."
Hopper, "Joyce, 99 out of 100 times, kid goes missing,"
Hopper, "the kid is with a parent or relative."
Joyce, "What about the other time?"
