I have to make something called a visual aid. I hope Mrs. Gracey will give me an A. Some exciting news. Joyce got an amazing new job. She gets to work at home. She says she loves the 'freedom.' Will is painting a lot, but he… he won’t show me what he’s working on. Maybe it is for a girl. I think there is someone he likes, because he has been acting weird. Jonathan is acting weird also. I think he is just nervous about college. He is still waiting for his big letter. I hope he and Nancy get to go together. But I don’t know how he’ll get to college because his car is still broken. His funny friend Argyle has been taking us to school. His hair is longer than mine. And he and Jonathan like to smoke smelly plants together. Jonathan says the plants are super safe because they come from the earth, but to not tell Joyce. Me? I am twice as happy now. You were right. It just takes time. I think I have finally adapted. At first, I missed all the spring flowers, but now I find it pretty here too. I even like school now. I am still best at math, but my grammar is getting good now also. It helps that everyone is so nice here. I have made lots of friends. Even so, I am ready for spring break, mostly because I get to see you. I am so excited to see you, it is hard to breathe.
