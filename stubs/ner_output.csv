4,3,"[faint rumbling] [dishware rattling] [ominous rumbling building] [pots and pans clanging] - [helicopter blades whirring] - [woman gasps] [dramatic music playing] [woman grunts] Sam. [blades slowing] [dramatic musical flourish] [Sullivan] There were no signs of any attacker. No bruises. No signs of any struggle. It's as if her attacker was a ghost. Does this remind you of anything, Doctor? No, it doesn't. Are you sure? Why are you here? Really. I'd like your opinion. I was fired, in case you forgot. A foreign government invaded our country, all under your watch. There had to be consequences. Certainly you understand that. What I understand is that something… something is going on in that town that nobody… nobody fully comprehends. And I also understand that military strength is not the answer. So what is the answer, Doctor? More scientists? Because it was men of science, men like you, who created this problem in the first place. [tense music playing] Everything that has happened in Hawkins can be traced back to Brenner's little pet. Wouldn't you agree? [tense music intensifies] [energy thrumming] [bones snapping] [tense music continues] Dr. Brenner trained her for this very thing. Remote assassinations. What you're suggesting is impossible. - Is it? - Eleven is dead. - I'm not convinced. - So, where has she been all this time? There are rumors she's alive and receiving help from someone on the inside. Are you saying I'm helping her? Is that what you're saying? If I wanted to chat, Doctor, I would've picked up the damn phone. Now, you can make this easy and tell us where she is, or… We can do this the hard way. - [door clattering] - [soldier 1] Not in here. Go! Go! Go! - [soldier 2] Move! - [soldier 1] Nothing. [soldiers speaking indistinctly] [woman] <i>Why are you taking that box?</i> Those are Peter's old school projects. You do not need those. Hey! I'm talking to you! Sam, do something. [tense music building] [helicopter whirring] [Sullivan] I wanna know everything he's done, everyone he's spoken to in the past year. And if we're lucky, he'll lead us right to the girl. [tense music swells, fades] [theme music playing] [siren wailing in distance] [eerie, unsettling music playing] - [Angela shudders] - [EMT] Can you tell me your name? - Um, Angela. - Angela. Do you know where you are, Angela? - Um, Rink… Rink-O-Mania, I think? - Rink-O-Mania. Very good. - Now, where does it hurt, sweetie? - My head. [EMT] Your head hurts? And my nose. [Angela whimpering, crying] - [eerie, unsettling music continues] - [Angela] I can't breathe. [EMT] Just try to take some deep breaths. Breathe slow for me, okay? That's it. I know it's a lot of blood, but you're going to be okay. - [Angela] I don't think so. - I promise. Just need you to answer a few more questions, all right? - [unsettling music intensifies] - [Angela] Okay. [faint pulsing] [Angela] No. [Angela] I don't know. [pulsing continues] [Argyle] <i>I know</i> <i>this may be, like, upsetting and shit,</i> <i>but that future prom queen is gonna be fine.</i> It's just, like, rubber wheels. - [Jonathan] Plastic. - [Argyle] Oh. Not like hard plastic. Just… - Just the soft kind. - Totally. But you ever wonder why the wheels aren't wood, man? Or metal? So people don't get hurt when they get shmacked. - Oh. - Yeah. Because it happens more than you think, man. Roller-skate attacks. Man. Hey, at least it wasn't an ice skate. That nose would've been sliced clean off, man. [exclaims] - It could've been so much worse. - So much worse. In the grand scheme of things, it's just a little blip. That's a funny word, man. ""Blip."" - ""Blip."" - ""Blip."" [both, in time to jaunty music] Blip, blip, blip, blip, blip, blip, blip. [Jonathan and Argyle continue] [grandiose opera music playing faintly] [opera music intensifies] - Mom? - [door closes] [yells] Well, well! Aren't you lot a sight for sore eyes, huh? - Hi, Murray. - You kids like risotto? [laughs] Yeah. [Murray] There I was, headed down the I-5, going to see a client in Ventura. I'm looking for a motel to stay for the night, and suddenly, bam, it hits me. ""Didn't the Byers move here?"" Small world, isn't it? It's a small world. [Murray] So I thought, ""Hey, you know what?"" ""Why don't I drop in, say hello to my old friends?"" [chuckles] It's so sweet of you. - Sweeter of you to let me stay. [chuckles] - [Joyce] And he cooks. Mm, and cleans. A regular little housewife. [Joyce] You should stay. I'd be tempted, Joyce, except, you know, you have that, uh… Right, that business trip. Business trip? What business trip? Oh my gosh. [chuckles] I almost forgot to tell you guys. - This thing came up at work… - Can you pass me the olive oil? That's wine. And it turns out I have to go to a conference tomorrow. In Alaska. - Alaska? - Tomorrow? Crazy, right? [chuckles] That's where they're based, the Britannicas. Joan and Brian Britannica. [Murray sighs] Mm. So do Eskimos, like, still live in igloos, or, uh, are they, like, fully-blown, like, living in the… in the suburbs now? Who is this? So, Jonathan, this means you're gonna have to, you know, take charge while I'm gone. - [Murray] Yeah. - Wait. What? What's going on? - Oh my… - Your mom's going to Alaska. You're going to Alaska? [Argyle] Mm-hmm. - What's going on in Alaska? - The Britannicas are there. - The Britannicas? - Mm-hmm. Jonathan, what is wrong with you? - I think I know what's wrong with him. - We just had a super stressful day. Stress, huh? This girl got shmacked in the head today at the roller rink. - Shmacked? - Yeah, one of those vicious skate attacks. - A skate attack? - Yeah, but it wasn't an ice skate. It was… - [Jonathan] It was a plastic skate. - No, it was, like, rubber. Rubber. Rubber. - Rubber. - [Argyle] You know what? I'm not sure. Anyway, she looked like she's gonna be fine. - She's totally fine. - She didn't look fine. [Joyce] El, aren't you gonna finish your... What…? [footsteps receding] - [Will sighs] - What is going on, you guys? Okay, I, uh, I sense tension. [chuckles] Is it the risotto? Everyone hates the risotto? - Absolutely not. No, it's incredible. - Mm-mm. This risotto is shmackin', dude. [chuckles] Still have no idea who he is. [delicate, somber music playing] [Mike, echoing] <i>What did you do?</i> What did you do? - [Eleven, echoing] Angela! - [Angela screaming] [eerie audio distortion] What have you done? [echoing] What have you done? [eerie audio distortion] [sinister music playing] [creature screeches] [cries shrilly] [screeches] [chittering] [sinister music continues] [tentacles slithering] [tentacles squelching] [trilling] [wet rustling] [music builds in intensity] [energy booms] [sinister music fades] [indistinct chatter in distance] [distant clattering] [indistinct chatter continues] [boy 1] He sees all this? He sees us? He'll shit his pants and cry for Mommy. This guy's no fighter. [boy 2] Hope he tries something. Gives me a reason. [boy 3] Hell, yeah. Well, well, look who's decided to join. What are you guys doing? - We're gearing up. - Preparing for the hunt. [menacing music playing] [wrench and bat clang] Hey, man. Relax. We're not killers like Eddie. We just wanna talk to him. Get him to admit his crime. Yeah, a little friendly neighborhood chat. Hey. You didn't know Chris. If you're not up to this, you can go home. There's no judgment. You'll still be one of us, all right? No. I'm good. I wanna help. All right. Let's capture us a freak. [menacing music swells, fades] [Eddie panting] [floorboards creaking] [whispering] Shit. Oh shit. - [loud bang] - Jesus… [eerie musical flourish] Delivery service. [exhales] So we got, uh, some good news and some bad news. - How do you prefer it? - Bad news first, always. [Dustin] All right. Bad news. We tapped into the Hawkins PD dispatch with our Cerebro, and they're definitely looking for you. Also, they're, uh, pretty convinced you killed Chrissy. Like, 100% kind of convinced. - And the good news? - [Robin] Your name hasn't gone public yet. But if we found out about you, it's a matter of time before others do. And once that gets out, everyone and their shallow-minded mother is gonna be gunning for you. Hunt the freak, right? - Exactly. - Shit. So, before that happens, we find Vecna, kill him, and prove your innocence. That's all, Dustin? That's all? Yeah, no, that's pretty much it. [Robin] Listen, Eddie, I know everything Dustin is saying sounds totally delusional, but we've actually been through this before. I mean, they have a… a few times, and… and I have once. Mine was more human-flesh-based, theirs was more smoke-related, but bottom line is, collectively, I really feel we got this. We usually rely on this girl who has super powers. - But, uh, those went bye-bye, so… - So we're technically in more of the... - Kinda… - Brainstorming phase. Brainstorming. [Dustin splutters] There… There's nothing to worry about. [scoffs] [sirens wailing] - [whispers] Shit. - Tarp. Tarp. Tarp. [sirens increasing in volume] [camera shutter clicks, echoes] [indistinct radio chatter] [officer] And after you talked to Wayne, what happened? I heard barking from the dog, and then… he was just gone. See anyone lurking about? Who looks like they shouldn't be there? No. No, no, there was nobody there. - ""Nobody."" - I already told this to Officer Daniels. Did you look into Victor Creel? - Sorry, what's that? - [Daniels] Victor Creel. Wayne got it in her head that the old nut did this. [clicks tongue] Victor's locked away. Don't need to worry about him, all right? Now, you said last you saw Fred, he was by the picnic tables. - Do I have that right? - [car approaching] Ms. Wheeler. [resolute synth music playing] He was by the picnic tables. Is that correct? Ms. Wheeler? Does the picnic table ring a bell? [skater] Whoo! [skaters chattering indistinctly] Hey, guys, there is a 4:00 p.m. showing of <i>Police Academy 3.</i> Could be fun. Maybe we just stay home today. What is this? You guys just gonna mope around all break? No one's moping. It's just the movie is supposed to suck. It… [sighs] [knocks] Hey, El. I, uh, made you some Eggos, but they're getting kinda cold. Hey, that's cool. Hop's cabin, right? [sighs] So, um, are we just not gonna talk about it? [Eleven, flatly] About what? I don't know, just maybe, like, about yesterday or… Everything. [Eleven] There's nothing to say. Yeah, I guess, um… I guess I'm just a little, uh… Guess I don't really understand. Why didn't you tell me what's going on here? I mean, you know I'm not exactly Mr. Popularity back at home. I mean, you've seen it. I've been bullied my entire life. I mean, I… I know what it's like. No. You don't. Okay. What don't I understand? I am different. [emotional music playing] I do not belong. You mean in Lenora? - Anywhere. - [sighs] Come on, you… you can't actually believe that. Everyone looks at me like… like I'm a monster. They just don't know you. You think I'm a monster too. What? Yesterday. The way you looked at me. You… You were scared of me. No. No. [scoffs] No, that's not… That's… That's not true. I was surprised. Maybe I was a little upset in the moment, but, I mean… I'm sorry. I just… I didn't know what to do. I mean, it just was so crazy. It happened so fast. But it doesn't change anything. It doesn't matter. I… I care for you… So much. ""Care."" But you don't… you don't love me anymore? What… Who… Who said that I didn't? You never say it. I say it. You can't even write it, Mike. ""From Mike."" ""From Mike."" ""From Mike."" ""From Mike."" ""From."" Okay, okay. Eleven, you're being ridiculous. What, like… What is this? You know what I think of you. You're the most incredible person in the world. And you can't let these mouth breathers ruin you. Ruin us. I mean, they're nobodies. They're nobodies. And you're a superhero. [emotional music continues] Not anymore. [emotional music swells] [TV playing faintly] [doorbell rings] Ten bucks says Mom forgot something. [chuckles] Yeah. I'm not taking that bet. Hi, does Jane Hopper live here? Uh, yeah. Um, what is this about? Is Jane's father or mother around? Uh, no. No, her mom's out of town. I'm her brother. Um, stepbrother. But, uh… I'm sorry, what… uh, what is this about? You may or may not be aware of an incident involving Jane at the Rink-O-Mania. That was an accident. - [officer] A warrant says otherwise. - [Jonathan] A warrant? Come on, that's crazy. That doesn't need to happen. - Hey there. - [tense music playing] You Jane Hopper? [tense music swells] [echoing] You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. You have the right to an attorney. If you cannot afford an attorney, one will be provided for you. [dramatic music playing] [Jonathan] Can you please tell us where you're taking her? [Mike] Are the cuffs really necessary? Officers, answer me. Eleven. Eleven, listen to me. Okay? Eleven, will you please look at me? Everything's gonna be fine. I am going to fix this. Okay? Just… Just stay calm and everything's gonna be fine. Okay? - [siren wails] - Just… All you have to do is trust me. I promise. I'm gonna get you out. I promise! [panting] - Has Mom's flight left yet? - [whispers] Shit. [plane engine whooshing] [woman on PA]<i> Ladies and gentlemen,</i> <i>the captain has turned on the fasten seat belt sign.</i> <i>Please make sure your seat belts are securely fastened.</i> [inhales, exhales sharply] Do you think I should've just told them? What? Told who? The kids. About Hopper. It… It just felt so wrong to lie to them like that. Mm. Right, right, right. Well… [inhales] …I'm not exactly an expert in parenting. [chuckles] But, for what little it's worth, I think you did the right thing. The responsible thing. Responsible. Your children, bless their mischievous souls… [chuckles] …they like to get involved. This way, what? They play too much Nintendo, eat too much junk food, smoke some ganja, pound some beers, experiment sexually. - What's the worst that can happen? - [plane PA beeps] Excuse me, ma'am? Sorry to interrupt, but you're gonna need to fasten your seat belt. [chuckling] Of course. Mm. Buckle up. Like this is really gonna save me if we crash. [dramatic music playing] [indistinct chatter] [chains rattling] [barking] [metal clanging] [heavy breathing] [in Russian] What is this, American? What is taking you this long? Are you tired today? Pig. What do you say? Asshole! [Hopper grunting] [grunts] [pants] [in English] Your Russian is getting better. So is your acting. All right. Come on, what is it? I bring news from America. I heard from your friends. They're bringing your money to Alaska. When? Today, I hope. If my pilot gets the money, he will bring it in his plane tomorrow. Then you can hitch a ride back to your country. I get rich, and you're a free man. - Sound too good to be true, yes? - It does. This pilot, you sure you can trust him? His name is Yuri Ismaylov. He's a smuggler. Supplies American goods to some of us guards here, including me on lucky occasions. Cigarettes, peanut butter, <i>Playboys,</i> the best America has to offer. - Great. So he's a criminal. - Of course. Who else do you want to do this job? Gandhi? [Enzo chuckling] [sighs] You're worried about your woman, is that it? I can see why you like her, American. When I talked to her, I can tell by voice that she's very pretty. - Feisty too. I like that. - [menacing music playing] Shame we won't meet. You promised me that she would be safe. And she will be. Let me handle Yuri. You have more important things to worry about. Remember, you miss that plane tomorrow, I am still rich, and you're still stuck in Kamchatka. So whatever it is you're planning, American, best get to it, yes? [in Russian] Antonov! Finish with your American toy, we need him on the tracks. Yes, yes. I am just putting him in his place. [spits, mutters in Russian] Nosy bastard. [in English] Where do you want it? [menacing music swells] [grunt echoes] [Nancy] You're saying that this thing that killed Fred and Chrissy, - it's from the Upside Down? - If the shoe fits. Our working theory is that he attacks with a spell or a curse. Now, whether or not he's doing the bidding of the Mind Flayer or just loves killing teens, we don't know. All we know is this is something different. - Something new. - Doesn't make sense. It's only a theory. No, Fred and Chrissy don't make sense. - I mean, why them? - [uneasy music playing] Maybe they were just in the wrong place. - Were both at the game. - And near the trailer park. We're at the trailer park. Uh, should we maybe not be here? There is something about this place. Fred started acting weird the second we got here. [Robin] <i>Acting weird as in…?</i> Scared, on edge, upset. Max said Chrissy was upset too. Yeah, but not here. <i>She was crying in the bathroom at school.</i> Serial killers stalk their prey before they strike, right? So, maybe Fred and Chrissy saw this Vecman... - Vecna. - Dunno about you, but if I saw some freaky wizard monster, I would mention it to someone. Maybe they did. <i>I saw Chrissy leaving Ms. Kelley's office.</i> If you saw a monster, you… you wouldn't go to the police. They'd never believe you. - But you might go to your... - Your shrink. [suspenseful synth music playing] Whoa, whoa, Nance. Nance! Where you going? Oh, there's just something I wanna check on first. Something you wanna share with us? I don't wanna waste your time. It's a real shot in the dark. Yeah, okay. Are you out of your mind? Flying solo with Vecna on the loose? No, it's too dangerous. You need… You need someone to… Here. I'll stick with Nance. Take the car, check out the shrink. - Don't think you want me driving your car. - Why? - I don't have a license. - Why? I'm poor. - I can drive. - No, never again. Please. Anybody but you. No. - No chance. - [Dustin] Come on. - [Steve] No. - All right, okay. This is stupid. Us ladies will stick together. Unless you think we need you to protect us. Be careful. - Just gonna stand there and gawk? - Shut up. - Why don't we go? Okay? - Shut up and get in the car. Wipe your feet. On the outside, not the inside. Always the babysitter. Always the goddamn babysitter! [dog barks] [low rumbling] [can clangs] [electricity buzzes] [fissure crackling] [foreboding music building] - [thunder cracks] - [creatures screech] [ominous synth music playing] [Vecna growling] - [boy 1] <i>Hey there, fat-ass.</i> - [boy 2] <i>I said leave me alone!</i> [girl] <i>Can I say no?</i> <i>I can't say no. He'll leave me.</i> [man 1] <i>It's just a cough.</i> <i>Doctors are wrong.</i> [woman 1] <i>She can't force me</i> <i>to go to that awful place.</i> <i>She wouldn't do that to me.</i> [woman 2] <i>I'll just tell them</i> <i>I fell again. I slipped. An accident.</i> [man 2] <i>You're out drinking again?</i> <i>Look at me. You're an embarrassment to this family.</i> <i>Goddamn disgrace.</i> - [high-pitched ringing] - [grunts] [boy] Patrick, your nose. - Huh? - Your nose is bleeding, dude. [ringing subsides] God, gross. Well, well, well, what do we have here? [garage rock music playing faintly] [Gareth] You're a little early, fellas. Show's not till next week. - Oh, that was music? - [Jason] We're looking for Eddie. He's in this band, if that's what you call this. What do you care? That's our business. [tense music playing] Lucas? What are you doing with these douche bags? You know these freaks, Sinclair? Uh, they know my sister. They tried to recruit me to their… Club, cult. Lucas, what the hell? We're just trying to find Eddie, man. Well, you have eyes, don't you? He's not here. [Gareth grunts] - Hey, man! - Hey! Hey! - Where is he? - I don't know! - Where is he? - I don't know! - [Gareth grunts, yells] - Hey, let him go, man! Let him go! [cymbals crash] [unsettling, brooding synth music playing] [Gareth grunts, exclaims] It's gonna be hard to play drums with a broken hand. [screams] Dustin! - What? - Dustin Henderson! - What? - Dustin Henderson! Man, he was… He was calling around looking for Eddie. Maybe he found him! See? That wasn't so hard, was it? Now… Where do we find this ""Dustin""? [music intensifies] [music fades] [officer] <i>That's when you struck her?</i> I'm gonna need you to give me a verbal response. [ominous music playing] Yes. That… That is when I hit her. And why did you hit her? I don't know. [snorts] You don't know? You know, the girl you hit, she got a grade 2 concussion. Did you know that? No. She doesn't seem that upset about it, does she? No, she doesn't. [officer] No, she doesn't. Did you wanna kill her? [ominous music building] I don't know. You didn't know if you wanted to kill her? [eerie audio distortion] No. No, you didn't want to kill her, or no, you don't know? I don't know. [camera buzzing, clicks] [officer] Turn to the right. [woman] <i>Jane Hopper.</i> Okay, yes, I see her now. It looks like she's still being processed. Okay. So, uh, what does that mean exactly? [woman] <i>They're putting her in the system.</i> <i>After, she'll be transferred to juvenile hall.</i> - What? - Jail? You're gonna put her in jail? [woman] <i>A detention hall for juveniles.</i> [Mike] <i>That's jail.</i> Hey, look, is there any chance we can just see her? - Are you a parent or guardian? - No, but... Well, we're her brothers, and we're family. That's not enough. You have to be a parent or legal guardian. You have to be kidding. Ridiculous. That's the law. You're not gonna change it complaining to me. You want to see Jane? Find your mother. Thank you. - [lock clicks] - [door slams] It's bullshit. Such bullshit. I mean, she wasn't even trying to help. - Then what do we do? - I don't know. I guess we have to wait for Mom to land in Alaska. [Will] Then she's gonna be in jail? - Yeah, I don't know. - Hey! - Hey! - [Will] Hey, Mike! - Hey, stop the car! - What are you doing? [distressing music playing] [whispering] Oh no. Oh no. [Murray murmuring] [sniffs, mutters indistinctly] All right. And here you go. Thank you. Um, how much longer? Oh, just a few more hours. Almost there. Okay. You and your husband have exciting plans? Um, we're seeing an old friend. How fun. [plane PA system beeps] - [food plopping wetly] - [indistinct chatter] [man speaking Russian] [in Russian] One person, one piece. Don't you understand?! I said one piece per person! [engine rumbling] [wind whistling] [prisoner sniffing] [man speaking Russian in distance] [in Russian] I am no fairy. No, no. You… ...hit. You… ...hit. I give bread. I will break your leg. [Hopper panting] You… ...hit. I give bread. [sniffs] And soup. [prisoner sniffs] [prisoner grunts] Crazy American. [metallic clang] [bleak music playing] Now. [Hopper breathing heavily] [music swells] [restrained, pained moan] Again. [blow landing] [blow landing] [blow landing] [hammer clang echoes] [bell tolling] [Robin in English] Help me get this straight. Eddie's uncle, Wayne, thinks that Victor Creel escaped from Pennhurst Asylum and that he's the one running around committing these murders? Pretty much. But Victor committed the eyeball murders, like, way back in the '50s. Well, '59. So, that means these murders predate Eleven in the Upside Down by about 30 years? Yeah. Which makes spooky Victor Creel like 70 years old. - Yep. - [bell chimes] So, he's a grandpa murderer who can turn invisible and lift people into the air. It doesn't make sense. I know. That's why I said it was a shot in the dark. I know. I just thought that by ""shot in the dark,"" you were being modest or hiding something super solid up your sleeve that you were gonna wow us with later. But this is really, truly a shot in the dark. Like, we are snipers with blindfolds on who've been spun around 50 times. [bell dinging rapidly] Coming! Hi. Sorry, we're in a bit of a rush. Could we get the keys to the basement archives? Of course. Give me one sec. Did I come off mean or condescending? - No. - Right. [plucky music playing] Sorry. It's just, you seem annoyed. You don't know me well. I don't really have a filter or a strong grasp of social cues. - Okay. - If I say something that upsets you, just know that I know it's a flaw. Believe me, my mother reminds me daily. - Got it. - All right, ladies. Here you go. Have fun. Yep. We'll try. [plucky, inquisitive music continues] [doorbell ringing] Max. Hi. Hi. I'm so sorry to bother you over break, but… do you have a minute to talk? Um, yeah, of course. Of course. Okay. She's in. I'm missing collarbones, not eyes. So, we gonna talk about… it? Huh? Sorry, talk about what? Your temporary insanity earlier today when you basically threw yourself at Nance? - That's not what happened. - Pretty sure that's what happened. It was public. There were a lot of witnesses. You implying I still have a thing for Nance? No. I'm not implying. I'm stating. And, as it relates to your steadfast refusal to date Robin, it's pretty much the only logical explanation. That's not the only one. And as for Nance, I was just trying to protect a friend. - A friend, Henderson. Okay? - Okay. Don't wanna find her with her eyes sucked out of her skull by this Vecna creep. [chuckles] You're bright red in the face right now. I'm not. I don't wanna talk about it. I'll punch you so hard your teeth will fall back out. Whoa. Too far. - Not cool. Sorry. - Not cool. It's okay. [clock ticking] It's just, with everything that's happening, with all the murders, it's… it's making everything worse again. You've experienced trauma, Max, and when you keep your feelings, your pain, bottled up the way you do, it doesn't take much to trigger them again. So now, when it rains, it storms. Yeah, I know. Do you think you're ready to talk more about that night? [ominous music playing] [sharp audio distortion] Billy! I live next door to where it happened. I'm sorry? To where Chrissy was murdered. The cops asked me a bunch of questions. Did they talk to you? I mean, I know you were seeing Chrissy. Max, you know I can't talk about Chrissy or any other student. Yeah, but, I mean, what if there was a serial killer on the loose in my neighborhood? Did Chrissy mention anything? Anything about who might have done this? Max, I'm… I'm sorry, I… I really can't discuss this. You wouldn't want me talking to any other students about you, right? If I were dead and it would help catch the killer, then yeah, I most definitely would. Well, let's leave that up to the police, shall we? [discomforting music playing] Yeah, you're right. The police totally have this under control. - Can I use the bathroom? - Sure. Up the stairs, to the left. Thanks. [discomforting music continues] [keys jangle] Here she comes. Here she comes. - What'd she say? - Nothing, just drive. - Steve, drive. - Okay. [tires screech] [Patrick] No one's home. - So, now what? - We keep looking. The town's not that big. Only so many places these freaks can burrow. [unsettling music playing] Where the hell is Sinclair? [Lucas strains, pants] [grunts] - [tense music playing] - [radio squawks] Dustin. [Lucas] <i>It's Lucas. Do you copy? Dustin.</i> Lucas? Where the hell have you been? Just listen. <i>Are you looking for Eddie?</i> We found him, no thanks to you. - You found him? - A boathouse on Coal Mill Road. Don't worry. He's safe. You guys know he killed Chrissy, right? That's bullshit. Eddie tried to save Chrissy. Then why do all the cops say he did it? Lucas, you're so behind it's ridiculous, okay? Just meet us at school. We'll explain later. I… I can't. I think some real bad shit's about to go down. What are you talking about? What bad shit? [Jason] Sinclair! [tense music swells] [static over radio] Lucas? Lucas? [Jason] What the hell were you doing? - I was… I was looking for clues. - Clues? What, freshman think he's Sherlock Holmes or something? [chuckles] Yo, let's go. I found one. [suspenseful music playing] What? A clue. I know where Eddie's hiding. [suspenseful music builds to climax] [tense, uneasy music playing] - [Mike] <i>What did you do?</i> - [Brenner] <i>What have you done?</i> [Angela screams] [tires screeching] [uneasy music intensifies] [pursuing cars accelerating] [tires screech] [threatening music playing] - You transporting a Jane Hopper? - Yeah, what is this? I'll take her off your hands. [threatening music pulses] [yelps] No! No! [emotional music playing] Hey, kiddo. [plane PA beeps] - Come on. We're here. - [snoring] - Huh? - Come on. [indistinct PA announcement] Oh, shit. [attendant] Welcome to Alaska. - [Murray sneezes] - Welcome to Alaska. Oh, God. This is spring? - Welcome to Alaska. - [Murray grunting] [wind whistling] [flight attendant] Welcome to Alaska. - [tense music playing] - [echoing] Welcome to Alaska. [dogs barking] <i>Welcome to Alaska.</i> [man speaking in Russian] [man speaking indistinctly in Russian] [foreboding synth music playing] [buzzing] [yelling in Russian] [speaks in Russian] [chains rattling] - [chains rattling] - [man speaking in Russian] [Hopper grunts] [sharp screech] [in Russian] Next! Next prisoner! [prison door locks] - [music trails off] - [Hopper groans] [grunts, pants] [foreboding chords playing] [grunts, pants] [pants] - [grunts] - [distending wetly] [grunts] [flesh stretching] [straining] [tense music builds] [stifled groan] [music fades] [Robin mutters in English] [machine whirring] Anything… juicy over there? Nothing new. Yep, same here. Victor seemed like a normal guy. Dead family, missing eyes, took a plea deal, sent to Pennhurst. Blah, blah, blah, blah. What are we looking for exactly? Nance? [knocking rhythmically] Any mention of dark wizards or alternate dimensions? Things in that vein? I don't know. Okay? It's starting to seem like this was just a big waste of time. You're obviously bored. Why don't you call Steve? I'm sure he'll pick you up. And I mean, I'm not really in danger here, so… You do know that Steve and I are, like, totally not a thing, right? What? So, I figure you and Jonathan are still going strong 'cause you guys are going to college together. You're one of those unstoppable power couples, but I… I just… I wanted to make sure that you knew that Steve and I are just friends. Like, platonic with a capital P. [Robin sighs] Just in case that's adding any tension between us. It wasn't. Holy shit. <i>The Weekly Watcher.</i> I can't believe they have this. Don't they write about, like, Bigfoot and UFOs? First, UFOs are absolutely real. Bigfoot I'm still on the fence about. But may I remind you we are looking for information on dark wizards? If someone's gonna write about that, it's gonna be these weirdos. [eerie music playing] [machine whirring] [Nancy] Ah. ""Elvis cloned by aliens."" You never know. [eerie music continues] ""Victor Creel claims vengeful demon killed family."" ""The murder that shocked a small community."" Ha, ha. That's very funny. I'm not kidding. Get over here. ""According to several insiders, Victor believed his house was haunted by an ancient demon."" ""Victor allegedly hired a priest to exorcise the demon from his home."" Pretty novel for the '50s. <i>Exorcist </i>wasn't out yet. Keep… Keep going. Okay, so Victor claimed this exorcism failed, but it angered this demon, which then murdered his family, removing their eyes. Victor believed he was spared as a punishment. That's pretty convenient for Victor. Yeah, or super inconvenient. Victor was declared legally insane by the court, right? What if this is why? It sounds insane. Just didn't go public because... The plea bargain. The records were sealed. What if a demon did invade Victor's home? It's just, this demon wasn't any old demon. It was Vecna. - Dustin, do you copy? - [Dustin] <i>Yeah, I copy.</i> So, Nancy's a genius. Vecna's first victims date back all the way to 1959. Her shot in the dark was a bull's-eye. Okay, that's totally bonkers, but I can't really talk right now. What are you doing? Breaking and entering school to retrieve confidential and extremely personal files. - [static] - Can you repeat that? Just get your ass over here, stat. <i>We'll explain everything.</i> - Thought they were talking to Ms. Kelley. - We leave them alone for two hours. [tense music playing] It's like a mini-Watergate or something. - [Dustin] Hawkins gate. - [Steve] Didn't those guys get caught? Holy shit. You found it? Yeah, and not just Chrissy's file. Fred was seeing Ms. Kelley too. [tense music swells] [Jason] So, if Sinclair's right, the freak is hiding here. We move through the woods here together, then Patrick and Andy, you split up. Go around this way. Me and Sinclair, we keep going, then flank his ass from both sides. That freak won't know what hit him. [tense music building] [tense music builds to climax] [music fades] [Owens] Sorry about all the theatrics. I… I didn't mean to scare you. But you got yourself into quite the little predicament, didn't you? You know, I relocated you guys to Lenora because I thought, you know, ""Safe town, small, dull, far from Hawkins."" ""Nothing could happen here."" And what was it, a roller skate or something? Ready to order some food? I think so. Yeah. I'll just… uh… Some more coffee and, um, I'll have a… How about the club special? Whatever you want, kiddo. It's on me. [country music playing faintly in background] Waffles, please. Never too late in the day for breakfast, that's what I say. Am I in trouble? For the roller skate thing? No, no, no, no. We'll make that go away. Don't even… Don't even worry about that. That's not why you're here? - [eerie music playing] - To be honest with you, kid, I… I wish it was. Last night, I saw something. Something I've been dreading for some time. I don't know how to say this other than just to say it. Hawkins is in danger. [creatures screeching] [energy crackles] [Vecna growls] You have fought this evil before and you've won. [Eleven screaming] But this evil, it's like a virus. <i>Each time it returns, it comes back stronger,</i> <i>smarter, deadlier.</i> A war is coming to Hawkins. Where you at, freak? [dramatic synth music playing] - [Jason] You sure Eddie was here? - Yeah. I… I'm… I'm positive. Let's check around the back. Around the back. [Owens] <i>There are good people,</i> <i>brave friends,</i> <i>who have helped you fight your battle in the past.</i> <i>But they alone can't win this war,</i> <i>not without you.</i> I know it's not fair to ask more of you, but I wouldn't be here if I didn't think this was the only way, if I didn't think you were the only one who might have a shot to hit this thing so hard it can't get back up. I don't have my powers. What if I told you there was a way… A way to bring them back? [dramatic music playing] [helicopter whirring] <i>I feared this moment would come, so I've been preparing,</i> <i>developing the means to restore your abilities.</i> <i>A program has the potential to not just bring them back,</i> <i>but bring them back stronger than before.</i> <i>But there are others who don't believe in you,</i> <i>who think you are the cause.</i> I believe they're wrong. I believe you're the cure. That's why, if we're really gonna do this, I'm gonna ask that you leave with me now. The reservation's under ""Byers."" [Owens] <i>But you should know</i> <i>there is a very real possibility</i> <i>this program fails.</i> <i>And if it does, you will never see your friends again.</i> My friends in Hawkins, are they in danger? [dramatic music continues] [Owens] <i>I'm afraid</i> <i>your friends in Hawkins are very much…</i> - Can I see Fred's file? - Yeah. <i>…In the eye of the storm.</i> You may feel you need to go to them now, but if you do, you will risk everything, risk everyone. [echoing] Max, I know something's wrong. [shrill, high-pitched noise] [music increases in intensity] - [thunder rumbles] - [gasps, pants] [Kelley] <i>Max, what you've been through…</i> [grunts] Billy! [Kelley] <i>…it's a lot for anyone.</i> And it's okay to not be okay. Max? What is it? [Dustin, echoing] Max! Max! [Vecna] <i>Max.</i> [Owens] <i>They're not</i> <i>the only ones in danger.</i> It's life as we know it. - This is why I'm here. - [purposeful music playing] Because I believe you are our best hope. Our only hope. What if I'm not good? What if I'm the monster? I don't know you that well, kiddo, but I'm betting the fate of the planet that you're one of the good ones. But you've spent too much of your life being told what to do by people like me. I know that. So, you say the word and I will take you back home. Or… Come with me now. Find out for yourself.

This... thing that took your son... [softly] we don't really understand it. But its behavior is predictable. Like all animals... it eats. It will take more sons. More daughters. I want to save them. I want to save your son. But I can't do that. Not without your help. Stop. I know who you are. I know what you've done. You took my boy away from me! You left him in that place to die! You faked his death! We had a funeral. We buried him. And now you're asking for my help? Go to hell. - [electricity crackling] - [groaning] - [breathing heavily] - Okay, now what do you know? I'm sorry. Did I stutter? I told you. Everything. [electricity crackling] What do you know? [panting] I know you do experiments on kidnapped little kids, whose parents' brains you've turned to mush. And I know you went a little too far this time and you messed up in a big way. I mean, you really messed up, didn't you? Big time. That's why you're trying to cover your tracks. You killed Benny Hammond, you faked Will Byers' death. You made it look like that little girl just ran away. See, I told you. - I know everything. - All right, who are you working with? Nobody. But I did give all this over to my friend at the Times. He's gonna blow this thing wide open. [chuckles] - [electricity crackling] - [groans] [grunting] You're just a junkie. A small town cop who had a really bad week. Took one too many pills this time. You made a mistake coming back here. No, I didn't. Here's what's gonna happen. You're gonna let me and Joyce Byers go... you're gonna give us anything we need, and we're gonna find her son. And then we're gonna forget that any of this ever happened. Oh, is that right? Yeah. That's right. Nancy? Jonathan? [door closes] - They're gone. - What? Nancy and Jonathan. His car's gone. They're probably just sucking face somewhere. - [Lucas] Gross. - No. No way!

[inhales deeply] [exhales] You gotta give me your word. Nobody's ever gonna find out about this. And those other three kids, those boys, you're gonna leave them alone. Then I'll tell you. Tell you where your little science experiment is. [sighs] [gasps] I don't understand. We came to an agreement. What? Look, everything that's happened here and everything that's gonna happen, we don't talk about. You want Will back? This place had nothing to do with it. That's the deal. You got it? What is this? Protection. The atmosphere is toxic. [stutters] But my son's in there. He... Put it on. [Connie] I'm telling you, this is a mistake. [Dr. Brenner] It's gone. Isn't that what you wanted?

Will, listen to me. It's me, it's your mom and I love you so much. I love you so much. I love you more than anything in the world. [echoing] Please... - [EKG monitor beeping] - [nurse] Blood pressure keeps dropping. Her pulse ox is falling. [Joyce sobbing] I love you so much. I love you more than anything in the world. [sobbing] Please, please come back to me. Just... - Come on, kid! - Please, please wake up. Please, please. [Joyce echoing] Breathe, Will, come on! - [EKG monitor flatlining] - [nurse] Flatlining! [sobbing] [Joyce echoing] Come back to me, breathe. I need you to wake up now. I need you to breathe. Please breathe! Please! [Will gasps and coughs] [Joyce] That's it. - Oh, my God, that's it, that's it. - [coughing] That's it, baby. Breathe. Breathe. All right. Come on. Come on. Breathe, breathe, come on, come on. Good, good, good, good. Just breathe, Will, breathe. [sobbing] Michael? Michael! Michael? [sobs] Oh, my God. Oh, my God. You're okay. You're okay. [EKG monitor beeping] Hey. - Hi, sweetheart. - [Jonathan] Hey. Where... where am I? [Joyce sighs] [Jonathan] You're home. You're home now. You're safe. Jonathan. Yeah, it's me, buddy. [sighs] We missed you. We really missed you. Are you okay? What, this? It's just a cut. It's nothing. You're worried about my hand. [both chuckle softly] [Jonathan] Oh, hey, uh... We, uh... We brought you some stuff... so you don't get bored in here. So... [sniffles] Uh, I made you a new mix tape. There's some stuff on there I think you really might like. [snoring] Guys. Guys, he's up. Will is up. Guys, Will's up. [Lucas and Dustin grunt] [Mike] Guys, come on. - [Mike] Byers! - [Dustin laughs] [Joyce] Be careful. Be careful with him. - [Dustin] Move. - [Jonathan] Guys, guys. - [Mike laughs] - [Jonathan] Go easy on him. You won't believe what happened when you were gone, man. - It was mental. - [Lucas] You had a funeral. - Jennifer Hayes was crying. - And Troy peed himself. - What? - In front of the whole school! - [Lucas] Yes! - [coughing] You okay? It got me. The Demogorgon. We know. It's okay. It's dead. We made a new friend. She stopped it. She saved us. But she's gone now. - Her name's Eleven. - Like the number? Well, we call her ""El"" for short. She's basically a wizard. [whispers] She has superpowers. More like a Yoda. [Dustin] She flipped a van with her mind, and these agents were trying to shoot us... - Yeah, it flipped over us... - Then she squeezed the brains out... [Dustin] And blood was pouring out of their faces. [Mike] It was pouring out of their eyes. [Lucas] Agents just started grabbing us and stuff... - [Dustin] ...shot out of the wall... - [continues indistinctly] [Mike] Something is coming. Something angry. Hungry for your blood. It is almost here. - What is it? - It's the thessalhydra, I'm telling you. It's not the thessalhydra. I'm telling you, it's the thessalhydra. - [loud thud] - The thessalhydra! - Damn it. - [Mike] It roars in anger! - Will, your action! - What should I do? I... Fireball him! Fireball the son of a bitch. - Fourteen! - [all exclaim] Direct hit. Will the Wise's fireball hits the thessalhydra. It makes a painful... [imitates screeching] and then... it crumbles to the ground. Its clawed hand reaches for you one last time and, and, and... and... [all cheering] Lucas cuts off its seven heads, and Dustin places them into his bag of holding. You carry the heads out of the dungeon, victorious, and you present them to King Tristan. He thanks you for your bravery and service. Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, that's not it, is it? No, there's a medal ceremony... Oh, a medal ceremony? What are you talking about? - And... - The campaign was way too short. - Yeah! - It was ten hours! But it doesn't make any sense. - It makes sense. - Uh, no, what about the lost knight? And the proud princess? And those weird flowers in the cave? - I don't know, it's... - [door opens] [footsteps approaching] Jeez, what's that smell? Have you guys been playing games all day, or just farting? [chuckles] Oh, that's just Dustin. He farted. - Dustin farted. [blows raspberry] - [Dustin] Okay. - [Lucas] Dustin farted. - Very mature, Lucas. - [Lucas blowing raspberry] - [Dustin] Oh. - Will. - [Dustin] Shut up. - [Jonathan] Come on. - [Lucas] Dustin farted! - [Will] Bye, guys. - [Mike and Dustin] Bye, Will. [Mike] See you, Will. - [chuckles] Stop. - No, you stop. - [Dustin] No, you stop. - [both grunting] [Dustin] Yeah, scream! You're like a little girl. [boys laughing] - So, you have fun? - Yeah. [Karen] Hey, boys. - Hey, Mrs. Wheeler. - Hi. Hey, wish your mom a Merry Christmas for me, okay? - Yeah. - Yeah, thank you. Uh, Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. - So, uh, you win? - Yeah. - Awesome. - Hey, Jonathan, wait up. - Uh... - Merry Christmas. Thanks, um... I... I didn't get you anything. - I... I feel bad. - No. No, it's, uh, it's not really a present. It's, um... Well, you'll see. Merry Christmas. - You ready? Let's go. - [Will] Yeah. [sighs] All right. Buckle up. Can I open it? Yeah, sure. Whoa. Pretty cool. [chuckles] Yeah. Yeah, pretty cool. [chuckles softly] [snoring] Did you give it to him? Yeah. [indistinct chatter] You leaving already, Chief? Oh, come on, you think I actually wanted to come to this thing? I was just hungry. Oh, yeah, that's the spirit. Well, your wife doesn't have time to cook for me, you know what I'm saying? [Powell chuckling] Merry Christmas, Hop. - Mmm. - [chuckles] [dog barking] - [Jonathan] What you got there? - [Christmas music playing] That one of yours? - Yeah. - [Jonathan] Looks pretty big. Be careful. You'll break it. What are you... What are you doing? [Jonathan] Documenting. Oh, why? - Because... - [Joyce chuckles] - It looks great. - Oh, this is just so overcooked. - And look, the potatoes are runny. - Mom. - They're so runny. - [chuckles] Mom, it's gonna be great. - It's definitely an Atari. - An a-what-i? The green present. It's an Atari. I felt Dustin's today, it's the same exact weight. - Really? Well... - [Will] Yeah. We'll have to see, won't we? Hey, no more snooping. No, I forgot to wash my hands. I'll be right back. Okay. - [softly] He's washing his hands? - [chuckles] [coughs] [retches] [groans] - [Jonathan] Thanks. - [both laughing] Are you okay? Yeah, I'm okay. [Jonathan] Mmm. Very good, Mom. Mmm. Hey, Mom. Did Will tell you about, uh, the game? - Oh, yeah. - No. What game? I threw a fireball at him and... [imitates explosion] dead. Wait, what is... You mean, this is... No, it's just Dungeons & Dragons. - Dungeons & Dragons. Right. - It's fun. - [inaudible] - [theme music playing] - <font color=""#D81D1D"">Synced and corrected by VitoSilans</font> - -- <font color=""#138CE9"">www.Addic7ed.com</font> --","[{'Joyce'}, {'Joyce'}, set(), set(), set(), set(), {'Benny', 'Will'}, {'Benny', 'Will'}, set(), set(), set(), {'Joyce'}, {'Nancy'}, {'Jonathan'}, {'Nancy', 'Jonathan'}, {'Nancy', 'Jonathan'}, {'-'}, set(), {'Will'}, {'Brenner'}, {'Joyce'}, {'Sarah', 'Hopper'}, {'Sarah', 'Hopper'}, {'Sarah'}, {'Will'}, set(), {'Jonathan'}, {'Jonathan'}, {'Jonathan'}, set(), {'Mike'}, {'El'}, {'Mike'}, {'El'}, {'Jonathan'}, {'Phyllis'}, {'El'}, {'Nancy'}, {'Jonathan'}, {'Steve'}, {'Steve'}, {'Nancy'}, set(), {'Nancy'}, {'Steve'}, {'Steve'}, set(), {'-'}, {'-'}, set(), set(), {'Jesus'}, {'Jesus'}, {'Will', 'Joyce'}, {'Will', 'Joyce'}, {'Will'}, {'Will'}, {'Will'}, {'Spencer'}, set(), {'Matthew'}, {'Will', 'Joyce'}, {'Will', 'Joyce'}, {'Steve'}, {'Jonathan'}, {'Jonathan'}, {'Jonathan'}, {'Steve'}, {'Steve'}, {'Steve'}, {'Jonathan'}, {'Jonathan'}, {'Jonathan'}, {'Jonathan'}, {'Steve'}, {'Jonathan'}, {'Jonathan'}, {'Joyce'}, {'Mike'}, set(), {'Will'}, {'Nancy'}, {'Mike'}, set(), {'Nancy'}, set(), {'Mike', 'El'}, {'Mike', 'El'}, {'Mike', 'El'}, {'El'}, {'El'}, {'El'}, {'El'}, {'Brenner'}, set(), set(), set(), set(), {'Papa'}, {'Brenner'}, {'Mike'}, {'Mike'}, {'Mike'}, {'Demogorgon'}, {'Will'}, {'Will'}, {'Will'}, {'Will'}, {'Joyce'}, {'Jesus', 'Joyce'}, {'Jesus', 'Joyce'}, set(), set(), set(), set(), {'Mike'}, {'El'}, {'El'}, {'-'}, {'El'}, {'El'}, set(), {'El'}, {'Joyce'}, {'Joyce'}, {'Joyce'}, set(), set(), set(), set(), set(), set(), set(), set(), set(), set(), set(), set(), set(), set(), set(), {'Joyce'}, {'-'}, {'Will'}, {'Joyce'}, {'Will', 'Joyce'}, {'Will', 'Joyce'}, {'Joyce'}, {'Will'}, {'Michael'}, {'Michael'}, {'Michael'}, {'Joyce'}, {'Jonathan'}, {'Will'}, {'Will'}, {'Lucas', 'Dustin'}, {'Lucas', 'Dustin'}, {'Dustin'}, {'Jonathan'}, {'Mike'}, {'Jennifer'}, {'Troy'}, {'Eleven'}, {'El'}, set(), {'Fireball'}, set(), {'Lucas', 'Dustin'}, {'Lucas', 'Dustin'}, {'Lucas', 'Dustin'}, {'Lucas', 'Dustin'}, {'Tristan'}, set(), set(), {'Dustin'}, {'Dustin'}, {'Dustin'}, {'Lucas'}, {'Lucas'}, {'-'}, {'Dustin'}, {'Mike', 'Dustin', 'Will'}, {'Mike', 'Dustin', 'Will'}, {'Mike', 'Dustin', 'Will'}, {'Will'}, {'Wheeler'}, set(), set(), {'Jonathan'}, set(), set(), {'Hop', 'Powell'}, {'Hop', 'Powell'}, {'Hop', 'Powell'}, {'Jonathan'}, {'Joyce'}, set(), set(), {'Dustin'}, {'Dustin'}, {'Mmm'}, {'Will'}, set(), set()]"

Oh, no, I just have always wanted to visit the Soviet Union. With Murray. You two getting along? He's the Star sky to my Hutch. I thought you were dead. [tender, emotional music playing] Thought I lost you. I did lose you. For eight months. [exhales] We had a funeral. Anybody show? Are you kidding? You're the hero of Hawkins. [chuckles] [Joyce] It's true. Yeah, I always felt I'd be easier to like when I was dead. [clicks tongue] [chuckles] How about El? She's good. She misses her dad. We all do.

Um, as long as Suzie's coordinates are right, about another 90 miles. Why? Well, once we save her, El, we should stop on the way back. El could make us, like, super rich, and we'd never have to work. We could just play D&D and Nintendo for the rest of our lives. Yeah. Totally. We're gonna make it, Mike. She's gonna be okay. Yeah, I know. I… I know she is. But… But what if after all this is over, she… Sh… she doesn't need me anymore? No, o… of course she'll still need you. She'll always need you, Mike. I keep telling myself that, but I… I don't believe it. I mean, she's special. She was born special. Maybe I was one of the first people to realize that. But the truth is, when I stumbled on her in the woods, she just needed someone. It's not fate. It's… It's not destiny. It's just simple dumb luck. And one day she's gonna realize I'm just some random nerd that got lucky that Superman landed on his doorstep. I mean, at least Lois Lane is an ace reporter for the <i>Daily Planet,</i> right? But… [Mike scoffs] - Sorry. - No. No, I… it's so stupid, given everything that's going on. It's just… I… I don't know, I just… Uh… You're scared of losing her. [tender, emotional music playing] Can I show you something? [chuckles] This is amazing. Did you paint this? Yeah. Yeah. I mean… I mean… I mean, El asked me to. She commissioned it, basically. I mean, she told me what to draw. Anyway, my point is, see how you're leading us here? You're guiding the whole party, inspiring us. That… That's what you do. And see your coat of arms here? It's a heart. And I know it's sort of on the nose, but that's what holds this party together. Heart. Because, I mean, without heart, we'd all fall apart. Even El. Especially El. These past few months, she's been so lost without you. It's just, she's so different from other people, and… [haltingly] …when you're… when you're different, sometimes… [sighs] …you feel like a mistake. But you make her feel like she's not a mistake at all. Like she's better for being different. And that gives her the courage to fight on. If she was mean to you or she seemed like she was pushing you away, it's because she's scared of losing you, like you're scared of losing her. And if she was going to lose you, I… I think she'd rather just get it over with quick. Like ripping off a Band-Aid. So, yeah, El needs you, Mike. And she always will. Yeah? Yeah. [mysterious music playing] [mysterious music intensifies] [Brenner] <i>After the attack,</i> you fell into a coma. Like One, you had pushed yourself beyond your limit. And it very nearly destroyed you. But that is where your similarities ended. [garbled static] <i>What you displayed that day</i> <i>was beyond anything I'd ever imagined.</i> [One screaming] <i>A potential I'd only dreamed of.</i> [screaming continues] <i>But when you awoke,</i> <i>something had been lost.</i> <i>Your memories,</i> <i>along with whatever else you'd found within yourself that day.</i> [monitor beeping] <i>But I knew then, just as I knew today,</i> that your powers had not been lost. They just needed a spark. [can crunches] But that day, you awakened something else. A doorway to another world. [building crumbling] [unsettling music playing] I always thought that Henry was out there, hiding in the darkness. <i>I didn't know for sure, not beyond a feeling.</i> Until now. He's claimed three victims so far, and when I saw the eyes, I knew… I knew that was him. He was sending us a message, letting us know he's back. That's when I came to see you. [gasps softly] My friends. Well, we… we haven't risked contact, but, as far as we know, they're… they're all safe. But I'm not gonna lie to you, Eleven. Your friends are in terrible danger. With each victim he takes, Henry is… Chiseling away at the barrier that exists between our two worlds. ""Chiseling""? [Brenner] Imagine, if you will, the barrier between our worlds is a… Concrete dam. [menacing music playing] Henry is putting cracks in this dam. Cracks in dams create pressure. Left unchecked, the pressure will build. And build. And eventually, it will reach a breaking point. And the dam will burst. [snap echoes] And when that happens, Hawkins will fall. [exhales] Well, that went very well, I thought. You eased her into it, nice and gentle, just like we talked about. Not ominous at all. [introspective music playing] [breathing heavily] [slams loudly] - [water gushes] - [Eleven sighs] [exhales] [Nancy, hoarsely] <i>He showed me</i> things that haven't happened yet. The most awful things. I saw a dark cloud spreading over Hawkins. Downtown on fire. Dead soldiers. And this… Giant creature with… a gaping mouth. And this creature wasn't alone. There were so many monsters. An army. And they were coming into Hawkins. Into our neighborhoods. Our homes. And then… He showed me my mom. And Holly. Mike. And they… They were all… [breathes shakily] Okay, but… he's just trying to scare you, Nance. Right? I mean… I mean, it's not real. Not yet. But there… there was something else. He showed me gates. [haunting music playing] Four gates. Spreading across Hawkins. And these gates, they looked like the one outside of Eddie's trailer, but… they didn't stop growing. And this wasn't the Upside Down Hawkins. This was our Hawkins. Our home. [Max] Four chimes. Vecna's clock. It always chimes four times. [music pulses ominously] Four exactly. I heard them too. He's been telling us his plan this whole time. Four kills. Four gates. End of the world. If that's true… He's only one kill away. Oh Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ. Try 'em again. Try 'em again. [keypad beeping] [line ringing] - [busy signal droning] - [phone clattering] - [Dustin] Anything? - [Max] No. Rang a few times, then went to busy signal. [Steve] Maybe you punched it wrong. Try again. - [Max] I didn't punch it in wrong. - [Steve] Well, I don't know. [Dustin] I think she knows how to use a phone. [Steve] I'm just saying, she could've typed it in wrong. [line ringing] [busy signal drones] - Same shit. - [Lucas] How is that possible? Joyce has this telemarketer job. Always on the phone. Mike won't stop whining about it. Yeah, but this phone's been busy for, what, three days now? That's not Joyce. No way. Something's wrong. [Nancy] She's right. It can't be just coincidence. It can't be. Whatever's happening in Lenora is connected to all of this. I'm sure of it. But Vecna can't hurt them. Not if he's dead. We have to go back in there. Back to the Upside Down. - [Steve] Whoa, no, no, no. What? - Nope. - Let's think this through. - What is there to think through? - We barely made it out of there. - Yeah, because we weren't prepared. But this time, we will be. We'll get weapons and protection. We'll go through the gate, we'll find his lair, and we'll kill him. Or he'll kill us. The only reason you survived is because he wanted you to. - He's not scared of us. - And for good reason. We were wrong about Vecna. Henry. One. Sorry, what are we calling him now? - [Dustin, Lucas] One. - Vecna. - Henry. - Right. We've learned something new about Vecna/Henry/One. He's a number like Eleven, only a sick, evil, male, child-murdering version of her with really bad skin. But my… my point is, he's super powerful. Could turn us inside out with a snap of his fingers. It's not a fair fight. [Dustin] Then why fight fair? You're right. He's like Eleven. But that gives <i>us</i> an upper hand. We know Eleven's strengths. And weaknesses. Weaknesses? When El remote-travels, she goes into this sort of trance-like state. I bet the same is true of Vecna. That would explain what he was doing in that attic. Exactly. When he attacks his next victim, I'll bet you he's back in that attic, physical body defenseless. Defenseless? What about the army of bats? True. We'll have to find a way past them. Distract them somehow. - And, uh, how do we do that, exactly? - No idea. But once they're gone, he doesn't stand a chance. It'll be like slaying sleeping Dracula in his coffin. That all sounds good in theory, but there is no pattern to Vecna's killings. Not one that I can decipher. We don't know when he's going to attack next. - Don't even know who he's going to attack. - Yeah, we do. I can still feel him. - [ominous audio distortion] - I'm still marked. Cursed. I ditch Kate Bush, I draw his focus back to me. Max. You can't. He'll kill you. I survived before. [dire synth music playing] I can survive again. I just need to keep him busy long enough so that you guys can get into that attic. Then you can chop his head off. Stab him in the heart. Blow him up with some explosive Dustin cooks up. I honestly don't care how you put this asshole in his grave. Just… [music intensifies] …whatever it is… Whatever you do… Try not to miss. [music swells, fades] [faint clattering] [person grunts] [grunts] [Hopper grunting] [panting] [grunting] [optimistic synth music playing] [music swells, fades] Bam. <i>Durak.</i> [in Russian] Son of a bitch!

Oh, nothing like a little prison escape to get your day started, am I right? We're not out of the woods yet. My people do not take kindly to escapes. They'll be hunting us. Yeah, well, we aren't exactly planning on sticking around. - Where's the plane you came in on? - That plane? Um, that crashed. - Crashed? - His fault. - [Yuri yelps, muffled] - [Murray] A word of warning. That man is more slippery than an eel dipped in baby oil. I wouldn't trust a word out of his mouth. [coughs, splutters] My tongue. My tongue! I… I can't feel my tongue. We need to get out of here, back to the States. Can you get us to another plane? Now? You're asking for Yuri's help after dragging him through miles of shit tunnel? I could have told you we are going wrong way hours ago. You Neanderthal... Watch your mouth, or I am gonna take this, I'm gonna rub it along the bottom of my shoe, and I'm gonna jam it down your throat. Well, go ahead!

Why so angry, comrade? Rough couple of days for you, I'm sure. But now you are free. Everything works out. Happy ending for everybody. No? For you, that will very much depend on how you answer. Comrade. Will you take us to America? Yes? [gun cocks] Or no? [dramatic musical flourish] [Eddie] Check this out. The War Zone. I've been there once. It's huge. They got everything you need for, uh… Well, killing things, basically. You think fake Rambo has enough guns there? Is that a grenade? I mean, how is any of this legal? Well, lucky for us it is, so… This… This place is just far enough outside of Hawkins. As long as we steer clear of main roads, we ought a be able to avoid cops and, uh, angry hicks. If we're trying to avoid angry hicks, maybe we shouldn't go to some store called the War Zone. Normally, I'd agree, but we need the weapons. - So I think it's worth the risk. - Me too. But is it worth the time? It'll take all day to bike there and back. - Who said anything about bikes? - You got some car we don't know about? It's not exactly a car, Steve. And it's not exactly mine, but, uh… it'll do. Hey, Red, uh, you got a ski mask or a bandanna, something like that? [spooky synth music playing] [man speaking indistinctly over radio] That was suffocating. Go! Come on. Where'd you learn how to do this? Well, when the other dads were teaching their kids how to fish or play ball, my old man was teaching me how to hot-wire. Now, I swore to myself I wouldn't wind up like he did, but now I'm wanted for murder, and soon, grand theft auto. So, uh, I'm really living up to that Munson name.

They're planning to kill him. To kill Henry. - [Eleven breathes shakily] - Okay. Okay. This… Does this Max have a last name? Max… Max Mayfield. Okay. So here's what's gonna happen. I have people in Hawkins, and I'm gonna send some to Max Mayfield. - And they will stop him... - Her. Stop her. And the rest of them from whatever foolish, although well-intentioned, mission that they're attempting, alright? No. No, do not send your men. Send me. Your friends are not prepared for this fight, Eleven. And neither are you. [ominous music playing] You must understand, when One kills, he doesn't simply kill. He consumes. He takes everything from his victims. Everything they are and everything they ever will be. Their memories, their abilities. And we do not know where he's been these lost years. But if he has survived this long, we can only assume that he has grown in strength. To underestimate him, to act rashly, would be very dangerous. I don't want to upset you, Eleven. What you've accomplished is nothing short of a miracle. [intense music playing] You came to me broken. And you've learned to walk again. But if you want to stop One, you will need to do more than walk. You will need to do more than run. You will need to fly. And you're not ready. My friends need me. I've stopped him once. I will again. I'm sorry. You can't. It's impossible. Nothing's impossible. I can call Stinson. She's got connections at Nellis. That's two hours away. And if we hustle, I'll bet we can be in Hawkins before nightfall. That would be a grave mistake. Waiting would be an even greater mistake. What if One makes his move before we've had a chance to throw a punch? Then what is the point of all this? That's a risk we're going to have to take. We pushed her before and look what happened. She lifted a 10,000-pound tank into the goddamn air. You don't understand what he's capable of! Maybe you're right. Or maybe you are overestimating him. Either way, doesn't matter because this is not our choice. We agreed this was not gonna be a prison. We'll show her what this is, what we can offer, and then it is her choice whether she wants to stay or go. Right, Doc? You may not agree with it, but here she is, standing before us, making a choice. You're sure you wanna do this? [determined synth music playing] Okay. Pack your things, say your goodbyes. [""Fire and Rain"" by James Taylor playing] - [Nancy] How's it handle? - [Steve] Not half bad. Considering that this is a… House. <i>♪ Yesterday mornin' They let me know you were gone… ♪</i> Yeah, it's… It's silly, but I… I've actually… I always had this dream that I'd have this really… really big family. I'm talking, like, uh, a full brood of Harringtons. Like, five, six kids. - Six? - Yeah. Six little nuggets. Three girls, three boys. [laughs] And… and every summer, I figured all of us Harringtons, we would pack into something like this and… just see the country. You know, the Rockies, Grand Canyon, maybe Yellowstone. End up in some beach side town in California. Spend a week parked in the sand. Learn how to surf or something. That sounds nice. Yeah? [tenderly] Yeah. Well, uh, except for the six-kid part. That sounds like a total nightmare. If only I had some practice. All right. Fair. That's fair. <i>♪ Oh, I've seen fire and I've seen rain ♪</i> <i>♪ I've seen sunny days That I thought would never end ♪</i> <i>♪ I've seen lonely times When I could not find a friend ♪</i> [Lucas] Hey. <i>♪ But I always thought That I'd see you again… ♪</i> So I've been thinking, two of the three of Vecna's victims were seeing Ms. Kelley, right? - Yeah. - Okay. So I figure there's a good chance Vecna cursed another one of her students. We go back to her office. We read all of her files. Look for mentions of headaches, nosebleeds, nightmares. - We identify his most likely next victim. - Lucas. - We stake out his house... - Lucas, stop. We don't have time for any of that, okay? And even if we did, even if your plan did work, we'd be putting a total stranger at risk. A stranger who has no idea what they're up against. I do. He uses my memories against me. But… only my darkest memories. - Same with Chrissy and Fred, right? - Right. It's like he only sees the darkness in us. So, I'll just run in the opposite direction. Run to the light. [mysterious music playing] And maybe he won't be able to find me there. Now, how exactly do you plan on doing this? I'm not sure. But it's my mind. Not his, right? So I should be able to control where I am. I just need to… push him away. Find a happy memory and hide there. Hide in the light. You got a memory in mind? Yeah. It was a time when I was the happiest. Was I there? [tender, emotional music playing] That's presumptuous of you. [chuckles] But yeah. You might've been there. Okay, but the second you start to lift, I'm calling in Kate Bush. - All right? - [chuckles] Okay. - Deal. - Deal. - [somber music playing] - [wind whistling] [grunts] Heh, come on. This way. [in Russian] If I get a whiff of any funny business, smuggler... I will not hesitate to kill you. In fact... I am just looking for a reason. Understand? Are you a parrot, cop? You keep repeating the same thing. [in English] You were trapped in a cell with this dull man and you didn't take opportunity to smother him. [Yuri tuts] [Yuri vocalizing] - [door slams] - Beautiful, yes? Please tell me this is another poor joke. You said you had a plane. - A plane! - No, no, no. I… I told you I could fly you home. And Katinka can fly you home, little bird. She was named Katinka after my first lover. [laughs] Katinka also had very beautiful, very round buttocks. Uh, mu… much like this. [Yuri laughing wheezily] This cannot fly us to America. Why not? As long as winds are not too strong and your military friends do not shoot us out of sky, we can make it to the coast. There, while we refuel, we skin dip in ice-cold water and wash off this muck. - [Joyce scoffs] - Then we fly her rest of the way. Happy ending. Okay, what is the furthest Katinka has ever flown? For me, she is still a virgin. [chuckles] Uh, not real Katinka. Goodness, no. [wheezy laughter] That Katinka, no. But this Katinka, pretty much unspoiled. But I'm sure she will soar when given a chance. She just need little tune-up. [tools clattering] - I did warn you, Jim. - [Antonov] Okay. Should I shoot him now? Or later? What about Owens? He… He's gotta have contacts or spies here that could help us. Can we do that? Can we make a call to the States? [tense music playing] [tense music playing] - [line ringing] - [indistinct chatter] [in Russian] Yes, hello, miss. I'd like to place a call to the United States. A very sick relative. [indistinct response] Correct. Yes... The number is... - [in English] The number? - It's 775… - [Antonov translating] - …305… …3450. [translating into Russian] [indistinct response] <i>Da, spasibo.</i> - [in English] What are you doing? - How exactly do you think this works? They will make the call for us, and then they will call us back. How long's that gonna take? Five minutes. Five hours. Five days. Who knows? And when we do get the call, assume the KGB will be on the other line, listening to everything you say. So, I suggest talking in code. Say the wrong thing and they will be on us like flies on shit. Welcome to the Soviet Union. [""Rock and Roll, Hoochie Koo"" by Rick Derringer playing] <i>♪ Couldn't stop moving When it first took hold… ♪</i> So much for avoiding angry hicks. Let's be… fast. - Yep. - Definitely. [patrons chattering indistinctly] <i>♪ Don't ya know I'm never gonna lose that funky sound?… ♪</i> - How many of these do you think we need? - Five or six. [romantic music playing] What are you gonna do? Stand and gawk? Shut up. - Ah! - [yelps] - Jesus, you scared me. - [chuckles] Whoa. You gonna mace me with that? [Vickie] If it keeps you in line, yeah. [boy scoffs] [music turns melancholic] See? Not so scary. [Steve] Robin. Robin! Who's that? Someone from band. [gun cocks loudly] How much is this? $120.99, but I'll throw in 20 rounds of buckshot for ya. [Jason] Hey, can I see this real pretty .357, please? - [uncomfortable music playing] - [clerk] Sure thing. - Here you go, son. - Thank you. Nancy Wheeler. Wouldn't expect to find you here. Yeah, well, it's just… scary times. [menacing music playing] [cart squeaks] I'm… sorry about Chrissy. Want my advice? Shotguns are not good for much of anything past killing small birds. I mean, they got power, sure, but not much range. And that's just gonna force you into close-range combat, then someone can just grab that barrel like this… [ominous stinger] …and redirect it. [cart squeaking] [threatening stinger] Well, you look nervous. Like I said, scary times. Now, your brother, he, uh… Is he here with you, by chance? Mike? Mike. No. I only ask because he's… He's in Hellfire, isn't he? - I don't know what you're talking about. - What about his friends? They here with you? Would you let go? [forcefully] Let go. What the hell is taking so long? [dramatic stinger] - What happened? - Gotta go. - Your old friends are here. - Shit! - Let's go! Let's go! - I'm going! I'm going! Sit down! [tense music playing] Should be up on our right. There's nothing out here. [van jittering] [sleepily] Mmm. We there already? - Already? It's been nine hours. - It's gotta be around here somewhere. What are we looking for, my dudes? - Some sort of facility. - A fence. A building. Any signs of life would be nice. Since when did we decide Nina was a building and not a small woman? Sounds like a small woman to me. It's not a small woman. Small woman out in this desert would be hard to see. - How is he still high? - Sure you got your measurements right? Yes, they're right. - You're 100%, right? - Yes. Maybe latitude and longitude are wrong. - Are you really questioning Suzie? - She's a genius, Jonathan. - Even geniuses make mistakes. - Well, she didn't. If that small woman is small enough, she could fit behind a small tree. Stop! Just… [brakes screech] - Ouch. - What are you doing? I am stopping us before we get more lost. [dramatic stinger] - [Jonathan] Give me the coordinates. - [Will] Um, okay. Longitude is 116 degrees, five minutes, and 17... Slow down. Slow down. [bird caws] Nina! Nina. Nina? [echoes] Nina! [chuckling] Holy macaroni. All right. You just go straight down. Like, straight… straight… Right on the money, as I said. - It just doesn't make sense. - [Argyle] Yo, dudes! My dudes! Jesus Christ. Come check this shit out! What is it? Gotta see it to believe it, my dudes! Come on! Hurry! Let's go! Let's go! Let's go! Pronto! Okay. So no small woman named Nina. But you said <i>any</i> signs of life, am I right? Right. Well, these are no regular tire tracks, brochachos. I mean, look at the tread on these monsters. They're fatties. And you know what that means. Military. We gotta go. [dramatic music playing] Well, I wouldn't do it if I didn't think she was ready. But either way, I don't think we have any other choice. <i>- Do you?</i> - No, I don't. <i>Yeah.</i> - It might take me some time though. - Just… As fast as you can. It's gonna take us two hours to get to Nellis as it is. And, Ellen, one more favor. Can you send somebody over to a Max Mayfield's house? There are some kids there that just need looking after, okay? - [line clicks] - Ellen? Hello? - [dial tone droning] - Sam? Hello? [door opens] [threatening music playing] Why the long face, Doc? We just wanna talk. [music swells, fades] [momentous music playing] [door clangs] No! Wait! No! No! [door locks] [panting] What… [Brenner] You can't leave, Eleven. [distressing stinger] Where is Dr. Owens? Dr. Owens had a change of heart. I know you wish to go to him, and there's nothing I can do to stop you from forcing open that door. But if my men hear you coming, they will kill him. - [Owens grunts, strains] - [handcuffs clicking] And alone, you will never find your way out of this desert to your friends. Here's what we're going to do. You and I are going to complete our work together. And when I decide that you are ready, we will return to Hawkins, together. Papa and daughter. [exhales] Why are you doing this? Because there's no other choice. There is a choice. Only one that is right. And you make the right choices? I try. Did you make the right choice with Mama? Four-fifty. [electricity hums] Your mother was sick, Eleven. She was a danger to herself and to others. She brought a gun into the hospital. She killed a man. Hospital? No. A prison. Everything I have done was for your own good. For your own protection. And Henry? [chilling music playing] You kept Henry in that lab. With the children. Was that for our good? Was that a right choice? I had no idea what Henry would do. I cared for you. I loved you. I loved all of you. Even Henry? Yes. I was trying to help Henry, to understand him. Yes. Yes, I cared for him. Even after what… what he did? Yes. Because I knew I had failed him. So this morning, you said you believed he was always alive in the darkness. Is that why I was searching the darkness? [eerie snarling] Was I looking for him? For Henry? No. No. We were focused on the Soviets. You knew that. ""Papa does not tell the truth."" Henry said that. And now you trust Henry? Henry, who's manipulated you like some puppet? You are the one who released him from his prison. You. And now you are angry with yourself and you're taking your anger out on me and you're risking everything. No. No, you. <i>You </i>have risked everything! <i>You </i>have lied! <i>You</i> made me look for him! - [Demogorgon snarls] - [screams] The gate. [wall crumbling] The Mind Flayer. [insidious hissing] So many dead. - [all screaming] - [bones cracking] And all because of you. Because you could not stop. You could not let him go. I came here to try and understand who I was. To see if I… If I was the monster. [groaning] [shock prods sparking] Papa! And now I know the truth. It is not me. It is you. You are the monster. I am going to open that door, and I am going to leave with Dr. Owens. If you try to stop me, I will kill you. [determined synth music playing] - [lights buzzing] - [door groaning] [Eleven yells] - [startling stinger] - [yells] [grunts] [grunts] You'll soon see the truth, Eleven. [Eleven screams] [Brenner grunts, screams] [distorted screaming] Ah! [distorted audio] [distressing music building] [music climaxes] Is this legal? Actually, I think it's a felony. Right. But it guarantees one thing. I won't miss. [metal clangs] - [Dustin] How's she feeling? - Light. But durable. Deadly. - But reliable. - [Dustin chuckling] [dramatically] Hear me now. There will be no more retreating… [in regular voice] …from Eddie the Banished. Hey, you're really ready for bat-tle. [chortles] You get it? ""Bat-tle."" B-A-T. No? [groans] I thought I had a good one. [bright, hopeful music playing] What are you doing? - [Eddie grunts] - You son of a bitch! [Dustin] No wedgies! No wedgies! Never change, Dustin Henderson. Promise me? I wasn't planning on it. Good. - Good. - Good. [laughs] Hey, Sinclairs. How are those, uh… those spears coming on? Flip that damn thumb around. What? It's too loose, Lucas. This isn't a basketball game where they blow the whistle when your shoes fall off. Okay, okay, for the record, my shoes never fell off. Okay, for the record, it's kinda hard for your shoes to fall off when you're riding the bench. Yet, for some reason, you show up to every game. Mmm, except the one that mattered. Plus, Mom and Dad forced me. Bull. Mom and Dad can't force you to do shit. Well, even though you're a bench-riding loser, you're still my brother. Just the facts. - [Steve] It just doesn't make sense. - What doesn't make sense? That was Dan Shelter. He graduated, like, two years ago. - So? - So he's in college. Which means he was visiting on spring break. <i>Fast Times</i> was returned, like, I don't know, a week ago? Right? Unless she's got some horn dog brother we don't know about. Which is possible. Or she's just really into Judge Reinhold? - Steve. - Nah. - What? - I don't care. I don't understand why you do either with everything that's going on. Honestly, this feels like a perfect time for that little pull of the rug because… In the face of the world ending, the stakes of my love life feel spectacularly low. Yeah. I mean, I get you there, but… I still have hope. - Not everything has a happy ending. - Yeah, yeah, believe me, I know. [Robin chuckles] [pensive music playing] I'm not talking about failed romance. I just… I have this terrible, gnawing feeling that… It might not work out for us this time. You think we shouldn't be doing this? I think we're mad fools, the lot of us, but… [sighs] …but if we don't stop him, who will? [indistinct chatter] We have to try, right? Yeah. To killing Vecna. Slash Henry. - Slash One. - [bottles clink] [low, menacing thrumming] [high-pitched ringing] [panicked breathing] [Brenner] It's only a precaution, Eleven. I never intend to activate it. [chilling music playing] I very much hope our fighting has come to an end. [whimpers] Shh. - Shh. - [whimpers] I know. You're angry with me. But it was the only way. [breathing shakily] The best way. [alarm blares] [alarm continues blaring] - What's going on? - [soldier] It's Sullivan. They found us. [dramatic music playing] [soldier] Go, go, go! [alarm continues] Three! Two! One!

If you're right, the killing ends, and you can pull the plug on her. In fact, I'll do it myself. But if you're wrong about this, God, are we gonna need her. Jack. Don't do this. I'm begging you.

You are my family. [breathing shakily] My child. [Brenner gasps] [gentle, emotional music playing] I've only ever wanted to help you. To protect you.

[hopeful music playing] [wind whistling] [hopeful music continues] - We need to get to Hawkins. - I know. And we will. But we need to get you somewhere safe. Gonna be people behind us. No, Mike, we need to get to Hawkins tonight. We'll never make it. That's over 2,000 miles. We need to find a way. If we don't, they are going to die. Who's gonna die? El, who's gonna die?

[all panting] [lights buzzing] [squelching] [eerie synth music playing] [bubbling and squelching] [rhythmic grunting] [squelching sound] [creature grunts] It's time.

[scoffs] Over there with the rest of the goddamn food stalls. It isn't rocket science. Sheesh, do I have to do everything myself? [ominous synth music playing] [clears throat] [Larry] My friends in state PD, highway patrol, they're all on the lookout. I got eyes everywhere. The second he pops up... I get a call. A call? Yes. A call. [chuckles] I mean, what more do you people want me to do? We want you to find him. [sucks lips] Let me explain something to you. This man is a moron, okay? He's driving around in a yellow convertible, for Christ's sakes. He sticks out like a sore thumb. I will find him. And, when I do, may I suggest you bring some backup with you this time? - Backup. - Some comrades. Since last time, he got the better of you. [Larry grunts] - [door whines shut] - [carnival music playing] - [Larry groans] - [hissing noise] [ride powers up] Please... I... I didn't mean that. You... You don't need backup. This man is your fault, your problem. You're lucky you still breathe. [choking] Very lucky. Please. I'm sorry. I... I have a bad temper. I'm going to therapy. You have one day to find this man for me. Nod if you understand. [choking] [playful orchestral music playing] [Hopper] Two Whoppers, extra ketchup, large fry, pack of Marlboro Reds, and one extra-large... Slurpee. Burger King is nowhere near the 7-Eleven, by the way. Never said it was. Let's try this again. Joyce. Alexei, the generators, what are they powering? And tell him that we know it is not the Starcourt Mall, so he can stop selling us that crap. [in Russian] Those generators you were working on, what are you powering? We know it's not the mall. [in Russian] This tastes like shit strawberry. - What'd he say? - He says, ""It's strawberry."" I'm sorry? His... Slurpee. [Murray] He says it's strawberry. So what? Hop, he did ask for cherry. I mean... Well, they didn't have cherry. They didn't have it. And it doesn't matter, because it all tastes the same, okay? It is sugar on ice. You tell him that. Tell him what? You tell him that it all tastes the goddamn same! [Murray, in Russian] It's all the same. Sugar on ice. No difference. [in Russian] Tell that stupid man it is not the same in the slightest, and I would like the cherry I requested. [in English] He respectfully disagrees. [Murray] It's not the same at all, and he would like... - cherry. - [chuckles] Oh, yeah? You tell him... he can forget it. [in Russian] He says forget it. No cherry. [in Russian] No cherry, no deal. [laughs] [in English] He says, ""No cherry... no deal."" [smacks lips] [Murray] Yeah. Hm. [inhales sharply] Mm. - [Hopper yells] - [Murray] Oh, shit! - [yelling] - [Joyce] No, Hop... - [grunting] - Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! - I'm not gonna hurt him! - [Joyce] What are you doing? - [Hopper growls] - Come on! Come on! I'm just giving him an opportunity to get his own damn... cherry Slurpee! - [Hopper grunts] - [Alexei whimpers] [whimpers] Jim, that man is an enemy of the state. Yeah, who's been jerking us around for a full day! I get him his cherry Slurpee, then what? He wants a helicopter to charter him to his own private island. I have dealt with assholes like this my entire life. [Hopper] Yesterday in the woods, he could've escaped, - but he didn't. - [chuckles] He stuck with us. Why do you think that is? It's because... he's scared. [Hopper] He's scared. Not of us, of them. He's scared of that seven-foot-tall Russian freak who could've killed him just as easily as us. Smirnoff knows that if he runs back to his comrades without a scratch on him, they're gonna think that he spilled his guts. So, whether he likes it or not, we... are the best chance he's got. Ooh!

But now, for some insane reason, the Russians appear to be trying to reopen it, which just destroys everything we risked our lives for. By ""we,"" you're including Lucas? Yes, of course. So, all that shit you told me, Lucas was there? - Yeah. - My brother, Lucas Charles Sinclair? Yes! I don't believe you. Wait, so you believe everything about El and the gate and the Demodogs and the Mind Flayer, but you question your brother's involvement? That's correct. Makes total sense. - Um, you need help with that? - No. - Well, I mean, it's taking a while, so... - Yeah, no shit, Sherlock. All right, so if we don't find a more efficient method to stop these fans, we're never gonna find help, and your ice cream buddies are screwed. Yeah, with that attitude, they are. Jee-zus! I'm just being realistic. I mean, we've made it about point-three miles in nine hours. Then we had to walk three hours down that tunnel, so I'd estimate ten miles back to the elevator, which should take us approximately twelve-and-a-half days. Did you just do all of that in your head? I'm good with numbers. Holy shit. You're a nerd. Come again? You... are... a... nerd. - Okay, you better take that back, nerd. - Can't put the truth back in the box. - But it's not the truth. - Let's examine the facts, shall we? Fact one: you're a math whiz, apparently. That was a pretty straightforward equation. Fact number two: you're a political junkie. Just because I don't agree with Communism as an ideology... Fact number three: you love My Little Pony. And what does My Little Pony have to do with this? Ah, let's recall the ponies' latest adventure, shall we? The evil centaur team and Tirek turns Applejack into a dragon at Midnight Castle, and then Megan and the other ponies have to use Moochick's magic to defeat his rainbow of darkness, saving them from a lifetime of enslavement. All the pink in the world can't disguise the irrefutable fact that centaurs and castles and dragons and magic are all standard nerd tropes. Ergo, My Little Pony is nerdy. Ergo, you, Erica, are a nerd. And how do you know so much about My Little Pony? Because I'm... a nerd. [electricity crackles] [powering down noise] Let's go... nerd. You... [Steve groans] That one stung. [gasps for air] Who do you work for? For the millionth time, I work at Scoops Ahoy! Scoops Ahoy. [groans] [Steve] What the hell?! Look at my outfit! Look at my outfit! You think I just wear this?! Think I'm a spy in a sailor's uniform? [groans] [grunts] How did you get in? [gasps] I already told you. I told you before. [gasps for air] My delivery didn't come, and my friends and I, we thought that it was left at the loading dock, so we went in the room, and then it turned into an elevator, and then... and then we dropped and then, next thing we know, I open my eyes, and we're in this... wonderful facility. But I swear to God, nobody knows about us, nobody saw us. You could just let us go, all right? And I'm not gonna tell anybody about this, okay? Shit happens, life goes on. And, uh... ice... ice cream. Ice cream, okay? You guys know what ice cream is. Everybody loves ice cream. I don't know if you have Russian ice cream or if that's considered gelato. I don't know what's what, but whatever you guys want, seriously. USS Butterscotch, I mean, you gotta try it. It is out of this world, I'm telling ya! [soldiers laughing] [laughs nervously] I like this guy! ""USS... Butterscotch."" [laughs] [soldiers continue laughing] [chuckles] [laughter stops] Who do you work for? Oh, come on. No, no! No, seriously... [soldier grunts] [soldiers speaking Russian] [grunting] Get your hands off me! [yelps, grunts] Hey... Steve? - [door buzzer sounds] - Steve? Steve? Steve? What did you do to him? What did you do? - [officer grunts] - [Robin groans] [whimpers] [in Russian] Put them in the chairs. [soldier speaks Russian] [Robin] Don't touch me! Steve... [grunts] Steve, wake up. Steve? [Robin grunts, yelps] What did you do?! [Robin grunts] Don't touch him. [clicking tongue] Steve? Steve, can you hear me? [officer, in English] I think your friend need a doctor. Good thing... we have the very best. [officer laughs] [soldiers laugh] You are going to regret that, little bitch. [speaks Russian] [door buzzer sounds] Bastards. Let us outta here! Bastards! Let us out! Let us out! [water splashing gently] [ominous synth music playing] [static hissing] [Mike] It can't be good for her to be in there for this long. Mike, you need to relax. What if she gets brain damage or something? - Oh, shit. Is that, like, a real thing? - No, it's not. He made it up. Mike doesn't know what he's talking about. - Oh, and you do? - No, I... Yes, from The Hawkins Post. I... I called a couple days ago about the... - [indistinct male voice on phone] - Yes, yes, um... I was just... following up to see if anything else had gone missing, or if... Okay. Um, sorry to bother... [dial tone sounding] [Max and Mike argue indistinctly in background] - [Nancy sighs] Who's next? - [Jonathan] There is no next. Unless you want to start calling random people's homes. - It doesn't make sense. - What part of any of this makes sense? There's a pattern, okay? A consistency to their behavior. They've been feeding on these chemicals since this started, and... and, what, they just stop, out of the blue? Maybe they have all the chemicals they need. Maybe they've all turned into those... things. But what about the source? I mean, did the Mind Flayer just suddenly stop infecting people? And even if the flayed are monsters now, why can't El find them? Okay, can you guys settle an argument for us? Who do you think should decide El's limits? Mike or Eleven? The way that you frame that is such bullshit. It's not bullshit, Mike. This is your whole problem. And it's also precisely the reason why she dumped your ass. El dumped you? Yeah, because she is conspiring against me. She's corrupting her. No, enlightening her. [Max] The fact is, she's not yours. She's her own person, fully capable of making her own decisions. She's risking her life for no reason. For no reason? Mike, the flayed are out there doing God knows what. - Killing, flaying... - Transforming into monsters. And El's not stupid. [Nancy] She knows her abilities better than any of us. - Exactly, thank you. - And she is her own person. - Exactly. - With her own free will. [Max] Exactly. El has saved the world twice, and Mike still doesn't trust her. You wanna talk about trust, really? After you made Eleven spy on us? - Wait, what? - Oh, she didn't tell you this? - No. - Your girlfriend used El's powers - to spy on us. - No, no, no, I did not make her. It was her idea. And why are we even talking about this, seriously? Yeah, who cares? - I care. - Yeah. - I guess girlfriends don't lie, they spy. - We were just joking around. Wouldn't it've been so funny if I was taking a massive shit or something? - You weren't. - But what if I was? - Then gross! - Seriously, Mike? I'm just trying to demonstrate how careless Max is with Eleven's powers. In fact, how careless all of you are. You're treating her like some kind of machine when she's not a machine, and I don't want her to die looking for the flayed when they've obviously vanished off the face of the Earth. So can we please just come up with a new plan because I love her and I can't lose her again. [door opening] What's going on? Nothing. Nothing. Just a family discussion. Oh. I found him. Found who? [Murray] He calls it the key, and this key emits a great energy. [Alexei speaking Russian] [Murray] It requires much strength, power. [Alexei speaking Russian] [Murray] Those houses, like the one you found, they're located near, uh, transformers. They're stealing from your town's power grid. Why build this key here? Why are they not doing this in their own backyard? What are they trying to do, blow us to smithereens? [speaking Russian] [speaking Russian] [chuckles lightly] [speaking Russian] There were many of these, uh, keys before in Russia, but they turned out wrong. [Alexei speaking Russian] They had to come to where the... where the, uh... Where the what? - I don't understand what he's saying. - I thought you were fluent. Oh, I'm sorry. Are my free translation services not good enough for you? Because you can just go ahead and file your complaint right up my ass! What is Smirnoff doing? - He's showing me. - [speaking Russian] [Murray] Oh, okay. Uh, he says the straw, they're using it to penetrate a hole in... a box? [speaking Russian] Okay, sorry, sorry. [Murray] The straw represents the key, which emits a great energy. [speaking Russian] They're using this energy... to break through a barrier, to open... a doorway. A doorway between worlds. [Alexei speaking Russian] [Murray] But it seems this key was only half the equation. [speaking Russian] Location... Location was the other half. [speaking Russian] Oh, what... [speaking Russian] In Hawkins, this door had been opened once. [speaking Russian] It was still... healing. Jesus Christ. So, this door is open now? [speaking Russian] [speaking Russian] He says it is... opening. - [creature shrieking] - [fluttering sound] [gasps] - Where are you going? - To call our children. [gasps] [in Russian] Can we watch Looney Tunes now? Nyet. [big band music playing] [panting] [grumbling] - Can I help you with something? - Whiskey. - You have whiskey? - No, but I do have vodka. [Hopper sighs] - [Hopper inhales sharply] - Oh! If there's a way to start this key, there's gotta be a way to stop it, yeah? Turn it off? - [Hopper inhales sharply] - [Murray sighs] - Right. - Right? [in Russian] The key, is there a way to turn it off? [speaking Russian] [in English] He says, ""Of course he could turn it off. Could... Edison not turn off a lamp, could Bell not hang up a phone?"" Cocky bastard. ""But..."" But what? [speaking Russian] But he is now... ""naked."" Sorry, ""exposed."" Compromised. Hey, I will get you there. I will get you to your key. [speaking Russian] [laughs] You wanna ask him what the hell's so funny about that? [speaking Russian] [speaking Russian] He says he likes your courage. You remind him of a... [clears throat] ...fat Rambo. [Alexei speaking Russian] [Murray] But he says that even thin Rambo couldn't get there. [Alexei speaking Russian] This key, it is in an underground fortress designed by the greatest Russian minds, guarded by their greatest warriors. [speaking Russian] [Murray] Breaking in is... impossible. Jackpot. [Dustin] Oh-ho-ho! Do you even know how to drive? How hard can it be? Max did it. - [Dustin] Aw, come on. - You seriously thought - they'd just leave keys in there? - There's gotta be a spare. [Erica sighs] - [Erica] Hey, Dustin? - Yeah? How big did you say that Demogorgon was? Big. Nine feet or so. Why? Found 'em. Erica? [loud zapping] What the hell is that?! A deadly weapon. Could be useful. - For what? - What do you think? Taking down Commies, saving your friends. Thought you were more realistic than that, nerd. We don't even know where they are, and even if we did, there are a million guards up there with weapons way deadlier than that. The best thing we can do for them is to get out of here and find help. Easy with that. Our chance of surviving, and theirs, rises substantially. Just trust me on this. Please? [engine powering up] [Robin] Help! [Robin's voice echoes] Help! - Help! - Hey, would you stop yelling? Steve! Oh, my God! [panting] Steve... Are... Are you okay? My ears are ringing, and I can't really breathe, my eye feels like it's about to pop out of my skull, but, you know, apart from that, I'm doing pretty good. Well, the good news is that they're calling you a doctor. [Robin chuckles] Is this his place of work? - I love the vibe. - [Robin chuckles] Charming. Yeah, tell me about it. So, okay, do you see that table over there to your right? No, your other right. - Oh. - Yeah, okay. - And do you see those scissors? - Uh-huh. Yeah, well, I think that if we move at the same time, we could get over there, and then maybe I could kick the table and knock them into your lap. - And I could cut the binds. - Yeah, and we could get out of here. - Gotcha. Okay, yeah, we can do that. - Yeah. Those morons. They left scissors in here? - Yeah, morons. [laughs] - Total morons. - Okay. - Okay, so, on the count of three, we're gonna hop. - Okay, good, hop on three. I gotcha. - All right. One, two, three. - Okay, that worked. - Okay. - All right. Uh, let's try again. - Right. [both] One, two, three. - Holy shit, this is gonna work! - We're close. Ready? Okay, one, two, three. [both grunting] [both groaning] [laughing lightly] It's okay, it's okay. Don't cry. Robin. [Robin giggles] Are you laughing? [continues laughing] - Yeah. - Jesus! I'm sorry! I'm so sorry. It's just... I can't believe... I'm gonna die in a secret Russian base with Steve ""The Hair"" Harrington. - It's just too trippy, man. - We're not gonna die. We're gonna get out of here, okay? Just... You gotta let me just think for a second. Do you remember, um, Mrs. Click's sophomore history class? What? Mrs. Clickity-Clackity. That's what us band dweebs called her. - [sighs] - It was first period, Tuesdays and Thursdays, so you were always late. And you always had the same breakfast. Bacon, egg, and cheese on a sesame bagel. I sat behind you two days a week for a year. Mister Funny. Mister Cool. The King of Hawkins High himself. Do you even remember me from that class? [Robin chuckles] Of course you don't. You were a real asshole, you know that? Yeah, I know. But it didn't even matter. It didn't matter that you were an ass. I was still... obsessed with you. Even though all of us losers pretend to be above it all, we still just wanna be popular... accepted, normal. If it makes you feel any better, having those things isn't all that great. Seriously. [sighs] It just baffles me. Everything that people tell you is important, everything that people say you should care about, it's all just... [chuckles] ...bullshit. But I guess you gotta mess up to figure things out, right? I hope so. I feel like my whole life has been... one big error. [chuckles] Yep. [laughs] At least it can't get any more messed up than this. [both chuckle] You know, I wish I'd known you in Click's class. - Yeah? - Really, I do. [Robin chuckles] Maybe you could've helped me pass the class. Maybe instead of being here, I'd be on my way to college right now. And I would have no idea that there were evil Russians beneath our feet, and I would be happily slinging ice cream with some other schmuck. [both chuckle] Gotta say, though, I liked being your schmuck. It was fun while it lasted. It was. - [buzzer sounds] - [door opens] [suspenseful music playing] [chuckles] Where were you two going? [clicking tongue] Try telling the truth this time, yes? It will make your visit with Dr. Zharkov less painful. [winces] [chuckles] Wait a second. Wait. Hold on. Okay! Wait, wait, wait! What is that thing? It will help you talk. Did you even clean that thing?! [screams] [static hissing] [gasping breaths] [Eleven breathes rapidly] [gasping, panting] What's he doing now? [Nancy] And that's not normal, right? Billy staying in his room on the Fourth of July? No, that's not normal. He wants us to find him. Yeah, that's what I'm afraid of. If we go to Billy, then the rest of the flayed know where we are. It's a trap, I agree. We'll be ambushed. We won't be surprised. We'll know that they're coming, and we will kick their flayed butts. You mean El will kick their butts. [Eleven's voice echoes] Papa! No. [Terry] Rainbow. Three to the right, four to the left. Sunflower. Rainbow. - [Mike] It's too risky. - [Nancy] Yeah, and unnecessary. Killing the flayed won't stop the Mind Flayer. We have to find out where it's spreading from. We have to find the source. [Eleven] Billy knows it. Billy's been there. To the source. - Yeah, but... - It's a trap. I know. [Eleven] We can't go to Billy, but I think there's another way. A way for me to see where he's been. [static hissing] El, I know you think you have to do this, but you don't. It's just, you've only done this before once. And your mom, she loved you, and wanted you to know what happened. And Billy's mind is... is sick, diseased. The Mind Flayer is in him. He can't hurt me. Not in there. We don't know that. Mike. I need you to trust me. Yeah. Just... be careful. [shivering breaths] [Eleven exhales sharply] [echoing] Billy. Can you hear me? I want to see. I want to see what happened. [suspenseful synth music playing] [whimpering] Something's wrong. [screams] Stop! No! No! No! No! [distorted roaring] [gasping] [Billy grunting] [tires screeching] [distorted screams] [squawking] [distorted wailing] [Mike, echoing] El, are you okay? Are you okay? [sighs] [softly] I'm okay. What's going on? I'm... on a beach. [Lucas] Okay, I may be dense, but the last I checked, there weren't any beaches in Hawkins. What else do you see? [tides crashing] [seagulls squawking] [Eleven] A woman. She's... pretty. I... I think she's looking at me. [echoing laughter] [woman] Woo! Yeah! [woman laughs] [woman] You did it! There's... a boy. Did you see that? Yeah, I saw that! That was at least seven feet. [woman] I don't know what it was, but it almost gave me a heart attack. Ten more minutes? - Yeah, okay, ten more minutes. - Okay. But any longer than that, Dad's gonna be mad, okay? [boy] Okay! [boy panting] Billy? Watch out for rip currents! I know. It's Billy. It's California. It's a memory. [seagulls squawking] [distant rumbling] I think I see it. The source. [panting] [ominous synth music playing] [thunder rumbling and crashing] [dialing on rotary phone] [Murray] Two minutes, Jim. It's a secure line, but any longer than that and they could trace you. Yeah, I want 'em to trace me. - What? - [Hopper clears throat] [phone ringing] Philadelphia Public Library. Uh... This is Jim Hopper... uh... police chief, Hawkins. [Hopper] I got this number from Dr. Sam Owens. What is your identification code? Identification code? You don't know it? You must be joking. Oh, no, no, I got it, I got it. [chuckles] I got it. You wrote it down and kept it in your wallet? ""Antique Chariot."" Listen. [Hopper] Um, tell Owens that the Russkies are opening the gate. Now, he'll know what that means. Not about the Russkies, but about the gate. Tell him that there's an entrance at Starcourt Mall. I know how to get in, but I need backup, a lot of backup. Have him call me back here at 618-625-8313. Your message will be relayed. - So, now what? - Now, we, uh... we wait. You compromised me, Jim. You do realize that, don't you? I'm gonna have to relocate. - How long do we wait? - As long as it takes. How can you just sit there being calm? I am not calm! Our kids are in danger! You said they were at the festival! Which is, like, ten minutes from the gate! [scoffs] What are you doing? Joyce? What are you doing? [phone rings] Philadelphia Public Library. Yes, hello. Uh, this is, uh, Antique Chariot's partner... Wheelbarrow. I don't think Antique Chariot properly conveyed the urgency of our situation. What are you doing? Can't just sit around and wait for a call. - Ma'am, I'm gonna need you to stay calm. - No. Don't you dare patronize me! I don't know who you are, if you're some glorified secretary or what, but if you don't wanna lose your job, here's what's gonna happen. When I hang up, you're gonna get up off your ass, and you're gonna go find Owens and tell him what's going on. We don't have time to talk about it and neither does he. He's gotta get to Hawkins, and he's gotta bring his men right now! Do you understand me? Yes, yes, ma'am. Thank you. And good day. It's been exactly one minute, Joyce. That's one minute too long. - Alexei. - [gasps] [in Russian] What's going on? We gotta go. Vroom, vroom. Back to Hawkins. Come on. [Joyce] Come on. Honestly, I don't really feel anything. Do you? I mean, I... I feel fine. - I feel normal. - Yeah, I feel... I feel fine. I kinda feel good. [both chuckling] - Wanna know a secret? - What? I like it, too! [both laugh] - I feel good. - Morons. They messed up the drug. They messed it up! - Morons. Hey, morons! - Morons! - Moron! Mor... - Hey! Whoa-oh! Oh, no. There's definitely something wrong with us. - Something's wrong. - [door buzzer sounds] [Robin chuckles] Would now be a good time to tell you that I don't like doctors? Let's try this again, yes? [murmurs] Who do you work for? Scoops. [chuckles] Scoops Ahoy. [giggles] How did you find us? Totally by accident. [chuckles] [Steve chuckles] [in Russian] More lies. - What is that shiny little toy? - [Robin] Where you going with that, doc? Whoa, whoa, hey, hey. Wait! No! Wait! Wait! - Whoa! - There was a code! We heard a code! Code. What code? ""The week is long. The silver cat feeds when blue meets yellow in the west."" Blah, blah, blah. You broadcast that stupid spy shit all over town, and we picked it up on our Cerebro, and we cracked it in a day. A day! You think you're so smart, but a couple of kids who scoop ice cream for a living cracked your code in a day, and now, people know you're here. Who knows we are here, little bitch? Uh, well, Dustin knows. Hey, Steve? - Yeah, Dustin Henderson, he knows. - Steve! - [Steve laughs] - Dustin Henderson. It is your small, curly-haired friend? Oh, curly-haired. Great hair. Small. Kind of like a 'fro. Yeah. Where is he? He's long gone, you big asshole. And he's probably calling Hopper, and Hopper's calling the US cavalry. [laughs] They're gonna come in here, commando-style, guns a-blazin', and kick your sorry asses back to Russia. You're gonna be two pieces of toast. [snickers] Is that so? Yeah.

If they had a permit. Now, correct me if I'm wrong here, Jim, but, uh... I don't believe they secured a permit from your office, did they? Not that I'm aware of.

She is sick. - Yeah, sick... she's sick. - She's sick. She's super sick. That's why we're here, actually. Yeah, we're shopping. Not for us, but for her, for Nana. - For Nana. - Also, we're here to get a gift for you. Just, we couldn't find anything that suited you and I only have, like, $3.50, so it's hard. Super hard.

Pretty neato, huh? Yeah. And this field affects any charged object in its vicinity. - Just like my magnets. - Just like your magnets. Okay, why is nothing happening? Oh, because our field is stable. But, if we reduce the current... How... The magnetic dipoles tried to orient according to the field, but... No, no, no, I mean, how is this happening at my house? You want my honest opinion? One of your kiddos got up in the middle of the night, bumped into the fridge, and knocked the suckers loose. And the magnets at Melvald's? - Apophenia. - Apo-what-o-whah? Apophenia. Uh... You're seeing patterns that aren't there. Coincidence. But what if... it's not? Well... Theoretically-speaking, I suppose some large version of this AC transformer could exist. A machine of some kind. A machine? But, in order to reach your house and downtown, gosh, that would take billions of volts of electricity and cost tens of millions of dollars. But it is possible. We cured polio in '53. Landed on the moon in '69. As I tell my students, once you open up that curiosity door, anything is possible.

[CHUCKLES] I mean, so much for being American heroes. - It's total nonsense. - It's not nonsense. It's too specific. It's obviously a code. - What do you mean, a code? - Like a super secret spy code. - That's a total stretch. - [ROBIN] I don't know, is it? You're buying into this? Listen, just for kicks, let's entertain the possibility that it is a secret Russian transmission. What'd you think they were gonna say, ""Fire the warhead at noon""? - Exactly. - And my translation is correct. I know that for sure, so... ""The silver cat feeds"". Why would anyone talk like that unless they're trying to mask - the meaning of their message? - Exactly. Why would anyone mask the true meaning of their message unless the message was somehow sensitive? Exactly. - So I guess that confirms your suspicion. - Evil Russians. I can't believe I'm about to agree with this strange child, but, yeah, totally evil Russians. So how do we crack it? Well, I guess we translate the rest and hopefully a pattern emerges. A pattern. Right, like maybe ""silver cat"" is a meeting place? Or a person. Or a weapon. It's probably gonna take a super genius to crack it, but... Where's Steve? - [ROBIN] Hey, Steve. - [COINS CLATTER] What are you doing? Uh, it's a quarter. I need... Do you have a quarter? [CHUCKLES] - Sure you're tall enough for that ride? - Quarter!

We're telling your mom. No. (LONNIE) Take a look at this beaut. Should've seen it when I got it. Took me a year, but it's almost done. Really? You want to check up my ass, too? I told you the same thing as I told those cops, he's not here and he never has been. - Then why didn't you call Mom back? - I don't know, I just... I assumed she just forgot where he was. You know, he was lost or something. That boy never was very good at taking care of himself. This isn't some joke, all right? There are search parties, reporters... Hopper's not still chief, is he? Tell your mother she's gotta get you out of that hellhole. Come out here to the city. People are more real here, you know? And then I could see you more. - What, you think I don't want to see you? - I know you don't. See, that's your mother talkin' right there. She even know you're here? Oh, great. So one kid goes missing, the other one runs wild? Some real fine parenting right there. Look, all I'm saying is, maybe I'm not the asshole, all right? In case you forgot what he looks like. (CYNTHIA) He's kinda cute, hmm? Maybe I'll trade you in for the younger model? (EARL) Just doesn't make any sense, Chief. You, uh, notice anything... odd about him the last few weeks? No, we're fixin' to go fishing down the Etowah next Sunday. I mean, he was lookin' forward to it. I know that. He got any enemies you might know about? I mean, people who might not want him around? (SIGHS) The exes didn't like him much. That's for sure, but... nah. - When was the last time you saw him? - Yesterday. Lunch, same as always. - Just you and the boys? - Yep. Me and Henry and... (SIGHS) Well, there was this, uh, this kid. No kid did this. Kid? What are you talking about? Yeah. At lunch, uh, there was this boy that, uh... I mean, he was trying to steal food out of Benny's kitchen. Can you imagine that? This kid... what'd he look like? Well, he was about yea high. You know, tiny like. I didn't get a good look at him, though. He was back in the kitchen. He look like this? Oh, no, that's... That's Lonnie's missin' kid. No. This was a different kid. This one had really short hair. I mean, it was buzzed nearly down to the scalp. Yeah, well, let's... You know, let's forget about the haircut. I mean, if this kid had a buzz cut... could it be Lonnie's kid? Well, I... I didn't get a good look at him. About the right height, though. I mean, could've been. Yeah, that's... Could've been. (SIGHS) Because I don't want to go by myself. Barb... Barb, it's not rocket science. You just tell your parents you're gonna stay at my place afterwards. No, tell them we're... studying. (KAREN) Nancy! Dinner! Coming! Look, I gotta go. I'll see you in an hour. Something wrong with the meatloaf? Oh, no, I had two bologna sandwiches for lunch. I don't know why. (CHUCKLES) Me, too. - It's delicious, Mommy. - Thank you, sweetie. So, there's this... special assembly thing tonight... for Will at the school field. Barb's driving. Why am I just hearing about this? I thought you knew. I told you, I don't want you out after dark until Will is found. I know, I know, but it'd be super weird if I'm not there. I mean, everyone's going. (SIGHS) Just... be back by 10:00. Why don't you take the boys, too? - No! - Mmm-mmm. Don't you think you should be there? For Will? - (GASPS) - (HOLLY GROANS) Sorry. Spasm. - (HOLLY WHIMPERS) - Oh... It's okay, Holly. - It's just a loud noise. - Nice. - (SIRENS WAILING) - (PEOPLE SHOUTING) Will! (VOLUNTEER) Better come out, buddy. Will, where are ya? (CALLAHAN) Hey, you think Earl really saw Will? I mean, what's he doin' with a shaved head? And stealing food from Benny? Tell you what, when we find him, we'll ask. Can't ask a corpse questions. - (WHISTLE BLOWING) - (VOLUNTEER 2) Hold up! You got something? - Hey, what do you got? - (MR. CLARKE) Not sure. Maybe nothing. I found this. In there. (POWELL) No way a kid crawls through there. (HOPPER) I don't know... a scared enough one might. His brother said he was good at hiding. (RHYTHMIC BEEPING) (RADIO STATIC) (MIKE) El? No adults. Just us and some meatloaf. Don't worry. They won't tell anyone about you. They promise. Right? We never would've upset you if we knew you had superpowers. (DUSTIN) Ow! What Dustin is trying to say is that they were just scared... earlier. That's all. We just wanted to find our friend. ""Friend""? Yeah, friend. Will? What is ""friend""? Is she serious? Um, a friend... Is someone that you'd do anything for. You lend them your cool stuff, like comic books and trading cards. And they never break a promise. - Especially when there's spit. - Spit? A spit swear means... (SPITS) you never break your word. It's a bond. That's super important, because friends... they tell each other things. Things that parents don't know. (MUSIC PLAYING ON CAR RADIO) (NANCY) Barbara, pull over. (BARBARA) What? Pull over! What are we doing here? His house is three blocks away. We can't park in the driveway. Are you serious? Yeah, the neighbors might see. This is so stupid. I'm just gonna drop you off. Calm down, Barb. Come on. You promised that you'd go. You're coming. We're gonna have a great time. He just wants to get in your pants. (CHUCKLING) No, he doesn't. Nance... seriously. He invited you to his house. His parents aren't home. Come on, you are not this stupid. Tommy H. And Carol are gonna be there. Tommy and Carol have been having sex since, like, seventh grade. It'll probably just be, like, a big orgy. - Gross. - I'm serious! All right, well... you can be, like, my guardian. All right? Make sure I don't get drunk and do anything stupid. Ugh. Is that a new bra? No. (MUSIC PLAYING IN DISTANCE) (DOORBELL RINGS) Barb, chill. I'm chill. Hello, ladies. (GRUNTS) (SANDRA) What are you doing? It's freezing. You ever feel cursed? You know, the last person to go missing here was in, uh... the summer of '23. The last suicide was the fall of '61. When'd the last person freeze to death? Hey, come back inside. Warm me up. Just... Just give me a minute out here. (SANDRA SIGHS) (LUCAS) What's the weirdo doing? El? Will. Superpowers. Did you see him? On Mirkwood? Do you know where he is? (MIKE) I don't understand. Hiding. Will is hiding? From the bad men?

[oar clatters] [Nancy] Are you okay? - [gasps] - Well, they took about a pound of flesh. But other than that, yeah, never better. Uh, do you guys think these bats have, like, rabies? - What? - It's just that rabies are, like, my number one greatest fear. And I think we should get you to a doctor soon because once symptoms set in, it's too late. You're already dead. [creatures chittering] [gasps] [creatures chittering] All right. There's not that many. We can take 'em. Right? [swarm chittering] You were saying? [menacing industrial synth music playing] The woods. Come on. Great. More running. [menacing industrial synth continues] [music swells, fades away] [synth intro music playing] [Wallace panting] How'd you sleep, Mr. Wallace? [wheezing for breath] Have you reconsidered your position? - Where's the girl? - [breathing shakily] Perhaps you need more time to think. [suspenseful music playing] [soldier] Let's go. No, wait, wait. Please. Wait! Please. Just don't kill her. Promise me you won't kill her. [suspenseful music builds] [music fades away] [faint audio distortions] [audio distortions intensify] [gasping] We're running out of time here, Martin. Hawkins is running out of time. I understand the stakes quite well. Sometimes I wonder if you really do. Or maybe you've just done all this 'cause you missed your daddy-daughter time. I've given you everything you asked for. I've compromised my principles. I've risked my life, my family's life. All because you assured me this would work, that this was the only way. But I don't see any progress out there, Martin. You know what I see? I see a frightened, traumatized little girl. Good for us. - [door opens] - [tense music playing] [door closes] [Brenner] <i>The truth is,</i> <i>you're regressing, Eleven.</i> You're going backwards. Eleven, look at me. Look at me. I know you're frightened. You're terribly frightened by what you've seen. But it's this very fear that's now holding you back. If you want Nina to succeed, you cannot hide from the truth, no matter how frightening it may be. I saw what I did. I am a monster. You speak of monsters, superheroes. That's the stuff of myth and fairy tales. Reality, truth, is rarely so simple. People are not so easily defined. Only by facing all of ourselves, the good and the bad, can we become whole. What if I don't wanna become whole? Then that is a choice. Your choice. The door is always open. This place is not a prison. This is. You chose to trust me once. I'm asking you to trust me again. Journey with me into the past one last time. Stop hiding, Eleven.

[screaming] [Powell] <i>What exactly</i> <i>were you all doing at the lake?</i> [Dustin] Uh… - It's comp... - We were… We were just going for a walk. [Callahan] A walk? At 9:00 p.m.? [squeakily] To the lake. We were gonna take a little swim. Little night swim. [Mrs. Henderson] Dusty. Someone was just murdered there. Yeah, we… we didn't realize that until we got there. That's why we didn't swim. And Nancy, was she with you at this night swim? - No. - Yes. Uh… We're not sure. [Dustin] She was there. Then she left. - It's all a little confusing. - That's when you guys came. Right. Then they dared me to say what I said. Oh, yeah. - About the killer. - [laughing] You're lucky you didn't get shot. Have you had any contact with Eddie? That psycho… freak killer? God, no. - Nope. Absolutely not. - No. We haven't heard from him. - We barely know the guy. - Who? Oh, that's a bunch of bull. - [both] Erica! - I mean, you realize they're lying. The whole couch is on fire. - [both] Erica. - Just the facts. Are you lying to these policemen, Dusty? - [high-pitched] No. - Lying to cops is a crime, son. - I'm not lying. - The fire is consuming us. Threaten them with a little jail time. Maybe that'll loosen their lips. - Okay... - You wanna send our kids to jail? - We need to take this seriously. - He didn't mean it like that. [overlapping arguments] - Shut up! - Oh my God. [yelling] Shut up! - Jesus. - Shh. We're gonna try a more civilized approach. One at a time. You first. - Wait, what? Why me? - Follow me. I'm not even in Hellfire. Do I need to cuff you? Up. Chop-chop. Let's go. [mysterious music playing] [creatures chittering] Oh… okay. - That was close. - Yeah. [Eddie] Too close. Oh, sh… shit. Steve? - Jesus. - I'm fine. I'm fine. No, no, no. You're not. You're losing blood. Come on, sit. All right? [grunts] [Nancy] All right. - [music pulses ominously] - Oh… [Steve grunting] Okay. So the good news is I'm pretty sure wooziness is not a symptom of rabies. But if you start having hallucinations or muscle spasms or you start feeling aggressive, like you wanna punch me, let me know. - Robin. - Yeah? I kinda wanna punch you. [laughs] Sense of humor's still intact. That's a good sign. Yeah. - Okay. - [Steve grunts] Okay. - You ready? - Yeah. Just do it. [wet squelch] [stifled groan] Sorry. It's okay. - [grunts] - Too tight? - No, that's good. - All right. [grunting, panting] Okay. Thanks. Yeah. [thunder rumbling] [Eddie] So, uh, this place is like Hawkins, but with monsters and nasty shit? Pretty much. Wait, watch out for the vines. It's all a hive mind. It's all a what? All the creepy crawlies around here. They're, like, one or something. Step on a vine, you're stepping on a bat, you're stepping on Vecna. Shit. But everything from our world is still here, right? Except people? As far as I understand it, yeah. So, theoretically, we could go to the police station and steal guns and grenades and whatever we need to blow up those bat things that are guarding the gate. I highly doubt the Hawkins PD has grenades, Robin. But guns, yeah, sure. Well, we don't have to go all the way downtown for guns. I have guns in my bedroom. You, Nancy Wheeler, have guns, plural, in your bedroom? Full of surprises, isn't she? A Russian Makarov and a revolver. Yeah, you almost shot me with that one. You almost deserved it. For your modesty, dude. [loud rumbling] [Robin] Oh my god! [all panting] [creature baying in distance] [creatures snarling] So guns seem like a pretty good idea to me. Yeah, me too. So what are we waiting for? [ominous music playing] [dark, industrial synth music playing] [music trails off] You know, what we are to attempt is quite mad. Even by your standards, American. Yeah? You got odds for us this time? [scoffs] I think… A thousand to one? [chuckles] Even if we somehow kill this beast, we still must escape. We fail there, I don't think they will be so kind as to throw us back in a cell. They will shoot us on sight. We'd die as monster slayers. You'll be a legend. But still a traitor. You forgot traitor. Monster slayer trumps traitor. I bet Mikhail will be proud of his pops, at least. Mikhail? - Mmm. - No. I can't do nothing right with him anymore, it seems. He will say, ""Papa, I bet that bald American did most of the monster slaying."" He's that age, huh? - Yeah, he is that age. - [Hopper chuckles] It is same for you, American? With your new daughter? The last time I was with El, she wanted just about nothing to do with me. I was just in her way, really. I think back to the way I was with my dad at that age. I was the same way. The exact same way. [emotional music playing] I think it must be hardwired into us to reject our fathers. So we can grow and move on. Become something of our own. I hope that's what she's doing. Coming into her own. But still... You worry. To worry for our sons and daughters, that is natural, isn't it? Yeah. But nothing about what El has had to deal with is natural. [jarring musical stinger] That beast, that monster in there, it's a part of something that wants to hurt El. To kill her. I don't understand. To be honest, neither do I. All I know is that thing… That thing shouldn't be here. It shouldn't be alive. Because it is, it means it still isn't over. I thought I was put here to pay for what I've done. But I might've been put here for some other reason. Maybe I… Maybe I can still help El. Even if it's the last thing I do. You almost sound religious, American. Religious? I don't know about that. But maybe I should give that prayer thing a try. 'Cause if we wanna get out of here, get back to El and Mikhail, you and me… We're gonna need a miracle. [Demogorgon chittering] - [horn honks] - [brakes creak] [indistinct radio chatter] Can I help you, comrade? My name is Yuri Ismaylov. [in English] Hello. [laughs] [in Russian] The warden is expecting me. I have a very special delivery for him. A rare import from America. [laughs wheezily] [suspenseful music playing] [Yuri speaking, muffled] [in English] Okay, okay. I'm okay. [gasps, chuckles] [buzzing] [suspenseful music playing] [mysterious music playing] [Brenner] <i>Try your best not to blink.</i> Any more headaches? Nausea this morning? How about your memory? Can you remember what happened now? Perhaps someone else can help fill in the gaps. Yes? [tense music playing] [Brenner] <i>Good morning, children.</i> [children] <i>Good morning, Papa.</i> [Brenner] Today's lesson is going to be about rules. Ah, for some of you, this may seem redundant. For others, it appears a refresher is required. Eleven, please step forward. Last night, your sister Eleven suffered a concussion during her alone time in the rainbow room. Now, she claims to not have a memory of what happened. But injuries of this nature don't simply happen. Someone did this. Someone in this room. Now, who's going to tell me what happened? [uneasy music playing] [Two] She must've… fallen. Fallen? You've seen her, Papa. She's clumsy. Stupid. [bullies snickering] Eleven, you may step back. Number Two, please step forward. [Brenner] Collar him. [whoosh echoing] [collar clinks] [collar clasps shut] Thank you. You think because you demonstrate some talent that you're somehow immune to the rules, is that it? No, Papa. That the rules don't apply to you in the same way that they apply to your brothers and sisters? No, Papa. Then why did you attack Eleven? - Did she tell you that? - Are you asking the questions or am I? Did you attack Eleven? If she told you that, then… then she's lying. - [Two pants] - [remote clicks, beeps] Papa, please, you have to believe me. Papa, please. She's lying... - [electricity crackling] - [pained groaning] [intense synth music playing] Now, shall we try again? [remote clicking] What happened? It was an accident. - [electricity crackling] - [pained groaning] [remote thrums] [Two's wail echoing] [thunder booms] [Robin] Couldn't we have tried a road, or something just slightly less creepy? [Nancy] I think we're getting close. We're almost out of here. Don't worry. [Steve] Eddie. Eddie. Hey, man. Uh… Listen, I just, uh… I just want to say thanks. For saving my ass back there. Shit. You saved your own ass, man. I mean, that was a real Ozzy move you pulled back there. Ozzy? When you took a bite out of that bat. Ozzy Osbourne? Black Sabbath? - He bit a bat's head off onstage. - I don't... - You know? Doesn't matter. - No. It's very metal, what you did. That's all I'm saying. Thanks. Henderson told me you were a badass. Insisted on the matter, in fact. - Henderson said that? - Oh yeah. Shit. Kid worships you, dude. Like, you have no idea. It's kinda annoying, to be honest. I don't even know why I care what that little shrimp thinks, but, uh, guess I got a little jealous, Steve. I guess I couldn't accept the fact that Steve Harrington was actually a good dude. Rich parents, popular, chicks love him. Not a douche? No way, man. No way. That, like, flies in the face of all the laws in the universe and my own personal Munson doctrine. Still super jealous as hell, by the way. Which is why I would never have jumped in that lake to save your ass. Not under any, uh… normal circumstances. [branch snaps] [growling in distance] Nope. Outside of D&D, I am no hero. I see danger and I just turn heel and run. Or at least that's what I've learned about myself this week. - Give yourself a break, man. - See? The only reason I came in here was 'cause those ladies came in straight after you. Now, I was too ashamed to be the one who stayed behind. But Wheeler right there, she didn't waste a second. Not one second. She just dove right in. Now, I don't know what happened between you two, but if I were you, I would get her back. 'Cause that was as unambiguous a sign of true love as these cynical eyes have ever seen. [subdued, emotional music plays] - [loud rumbling] - Goddamn it! Here we go again. Second on my list of least favorite things, earthquakes. Seriously, I'm unsteady enough as it is. Nancy! Where are you going? Nancy! [tense industrial synth music playing] Nancy! [thunder booming] Come on. [Dustin] <i>Steve, do you copy?</i> <i>Nancy? Robin?</i> This is Dustin. Where are you? We've been collared by the law. I repeat, we've been collared by the law. Do you copy? [radio squawks] Shit! [flushes] - Should we get lawyers? - [Powell] We're not ready for that. As far as we know, nobody did anything wrong. [Mrs. Henderson] But what if they did do something wrong? - Anything? - Nothing. - You don't think they went through… - Through Watergate? Without us? Without a plan? Without weapons? They wouldn't be that stupid. Yeah. They must just be laying low 'cause the law got us. [Erica] ""The law""? What is this, <i>Gun smoke?</i> <i>The Stupid and the Ugly?</i> Should I round up the posse? - Saddle the horses? - Erica. Please, just go away. Here's the deal. Either you tell me what's happening or I tell Dustin what I found under your bed. Please, no. Spill your guts, cowpuncher. - What'd she find? - Nothing. Is it gross? - Scale of one to ten. - A hundred. A hundred? The serial killer is a dark wizard from the Upside Down. And we've been looking for him, but he's in the Upside Down, which we can't reach. At least we thought we couldn't, until we found a gate at Lover's Lake. That was the reason why we were there, but these stupid cops grabbed us. And if you tell anyone about this, that's including Mom and Dad and Tina… [Erica slurping juice] …especially Tina, I… Will smother you in your sleep. Do you understand? Hmm… Erica? Do You copy? The smothering in my sleep part, but not much else. Why would they open up a gate at Lover's Lake? - What? - The commies. - The commies didn't. - Then who did? - Nobody. - So it just opened up for fun? Erica, you have no idea what you're talking about. No, she doesn't, yet she raises an essential question. How did Watergate open up? Only two gates have opened, so far as we know. One by El, one by the commies. But it's not the commies or El this time, so it… [eerie music playing] Holy shit. Wait, wait, wait, wait. ""Wait, wait, wait,"" what? There's one thing we've never understood. Which is why Vecna's killing people. What's his motive? Killing teens? It always just seemed too random. Too prosaic. On top of that, how does the Mind Flayer figure into all this? Maybe this is it. This is the answer. What is the answer? You sure you just want water? - We have Coke, Sprite, Dr. Pepper. - Coke works. Thank you. Okay, just hear me out. How did El open the Mother gate? She contacted the Demogorgon. With psychic contact. Just like… - Vecna when he casts his spells. - Exactly. So, what if, with each kill, he's not simply killing them, he's making a powerful psychic connection with his victims? A connection powerful enough to rip a hole in the fabric of time and space. He's opening more gates. Bingo. Copy. We're still at the Wheeler house. [police radio chatter] - Why would he be opening gates? - To take over the world. Who do we know that wants to take over the world? The Mind Flayer. So if the Demogorgon was just his foot soldier, Vecna's his five-star general. A five-star general with the power to open gates. - Holy shit. - Holy shit. Holy shit. That was incomprehensible. You lost me at ""Mother gate."" Please be kind. Rewind. [Dustin] Okay, so remember the gate? [Erica] Oh, no. I blocked that out. [Dustin speaking indistinctly] [Erica] So what was that giant laser? [buzzing, rattling] Might be time to get a maid, Wheeler. Come on. I don't want to stay here longer than we have to. [eerie, mysterious music playing] [Dustin speaking indistinctly and faintly] Those aren't guns. These heels are pointy, but I was hoping for a deadly projectile. - I don't understand. - Maybe you left them somewhere else. There's a six-year-old in the house. I know where I keep my guns. And also, I threw these away years ago. [mysterious music playing] Jesus. How many did you make? You said you wanted to help. I get that grades are important, but perhaps studying can wait till we get out? These are from sophomore chemistry. And this… this wallpaper, this is old wallpaper. And this mirror, this went to a yard sale. And you… You're not supposed to be here. No, I gave you to Cousin Joanna two years ago. [mysterious music continues] What is it? Nancy? You're freaking me out. I think the reason that my guns aren't here is because they don't exist yet. They don't… exist? This diary should be full of entries. It's not. The last entry is November 6, 1983. The day Will went missing. The day the gate opened. We're in the past. [eerie stinger] [Steve] Dustin! Dustin! Dustin! Can you hear me? Dustin! Du... Hello? Hel… Hello? - Maybe he really does have rabies. - Hello! Hello? What are you doing? Hello! He's here. Henderson. That little shit, he's here. He's like… He's in the walls or something. Just listen. Dustin. Dustin! Dustin! Dustin! Dustin! Can you hear me? [Dustin] <i>That brings us</i> <i>to the question you first raised.</i> How and why is there a gate at Lover's Lake? Let's analyze. What do Eleven and Vecna have in common? Dustin! - Dustin? - Dustin! All right, either this kid can't hear us or he's being a total douche bag. - Will found a way. - What? Will. He found a way to speak to Joyce through the lights. - [Steve] Lights? - Yeah. - The switch. Try the switch. - Okay. [Dustin continuing, faintly] [Nancy] It's not working. Guys? You seeing this? [energy thrumming] [Dustin speaking faintly] [mysterious, ethereal music playing] [Dustin] …to open a tear in time and space, just like the Mother gate. Whoa. [ethereal music continues] [Dustin] <i>…are these like the Mother gate…</i> But a gate nonetheless. [Steve exhales] It… Tickles. It kinda feels good. Does anyone know Morse code? [Robin, Steve] No. Wait, does SOS count? Is that… Is that good? So our working theory is that Vecna makes remote contact from his attic. We don't know why. We assume he can do it from anywhere. [energy thrumming rhythmically] - Are you even listening to me? - I'm listening. It's just… You said you followed Vecna through lights, right? Yeah, why? Because I think he's here. [ethereal music builds] It's working. ""S."" ""O."" ""S."" Hey, uh, remember when I said they wouldn't be stupid enough to go through Watergate? Yeah? I overestimated them. [wind rushing] [Murray] Warden, beautiful prison you got here. How about this? Huh? [laughs] How about that? Huh? Huh? - [Joyce groans] - That's what I thought, yeah. Warden. [chuckles] So nice to meet you. Uh, I'm Yuri, of course, but allow me to introduce you to my very... Shit. - [muffled] Murray! - I'm sorry. What? Can you <i>please</i> stop playing with that thing? I am not playing. I am practicing. Will you please stop trying to talk to me and stay in character? Remember, you are frightened, scared, confused. - Yes, I <i>am </i>frightened, scared, and... - Okay. All right. Yes. Good. [in Russian] Yuri Ismaylov. [laughing] At last, we meet. Comrade Major. This is the Bauman spy? [Yuri struggling, muffled] He looks different. Uglier in person, I know. He also shaved his beard to disguise himself. Tricky bastard. [in English] Silence, American scum! Enough from you. Enough! [Yuri moaning] [laughs wheezily] [in Russian] Now this one… This one I would recognize a continent away. She was more beautiful in her uniform, but still, quite striking, isn't she? Yes, very pleasing to the eyes, comrade. But not so pleasing to the ears, I am afraid. [in English] Where is he? What have you done with Hopper, you vile commie pig? [in Russian] As I said, unpleasant. But, I must say, I, too, am curious. The other American. What did you do with him? I don't know why, but I imagine him on a rack, in the cold, stretched thin, birds pecking his eyeballs. Am I... close? I have heard stories of Yuri Ismaylov, the Peanut Butter Smuggler. And you… You are not the Yuri I have heard of. I am… I am not? No. No. [menacing music plays] The Yuri I was told of had a screw loose. And you… Have many screws loose! - [laughs] - [menacing music stops] [intense, dramatic music plays] [Murray whoops] I hope we have not missed the show. On the contrary, just in time. [Yuri speaking, muffled] [guard yelling in Russian] This key here will give you access to that weapons locker. Choose any weapon you like. [dramatic music intensifies] Work together or alone. What… what is happening? They are being told the rules. Rules for what? I could tell you... but that would spoil the fun, now, wouldn't it? [Murray chuckles] You wait for the buzzer. You <i>wait.</i> You move before the buzzer... you will be shot. Is that understood? Is that understood? [prisoners] Yes. I'd wish you luck but it won't help you. [in English] Let us hope your prayers have been heard, American. [Demogorgon snarling] [Demogorgon pounding on door] [Joyce whimpering] [snarling continues] [chip clattering] [indistinct chatter] [unnerving music playing] [chilling audio distortion] [balls rattling] - [balls clang] - [chips clatter] You open for something a little more challenging? Try not to show any emotion as I speak, okay? Just keep playing the game if you understand. Two is still in the infirmary recovering. He's being watched now, but once he is released, he and the others are going to attempt to kill you. Right here, in this room. And Papa will allow it to happen. In fact, he wants it to happen. He's been planning it for some time now. [Eleven breathing shakily] Stay calm. Focus on the game. There's a reason why Two and the others were able to escape their room last night. Why the security cameras were turned off. Why Papa punished Two today. They don't even realize it, but he is moving them like pieces on this board here. Driving them to do exactly what he wants, which is… [music intensifies] Why? You frighten him. He knows you are more powerful than the others. And he also knows he can't control you. That's all he wants. Control. I saw all this happening. That's why I wanted to help you, but I only made things worse. Helping me… Made Papa hurt you. - [electricity crackling] - [orderly grunting] [sighs] And it is why you must escape. Today. But they are watching us. Closely. If you want to make it out of here alive, you must do exactly as I say. Do you understand? Why do you still help? Because I believe in you. It is time you are free from this hell. [music intensifies] [TV playing faintly] [cereal jingle playing on TV] Hey! [mysterious synth music plays] - I'm sorry! - Sorry, sorry, sorry. For your understanding. [Steve] Come on. Come on. - Okay, that's it. Go, go, go. - Yeah, okay. Okay, you guys seeing this? [Dustin, faintly] <i>…seeing this?</i> [mysterious, ethereal music playing] [energy hums] - Holy shit! - [Dustin laughs] [Dustin's laughter echoing] We're not moving it, but we're gonna unplug it. Stand by. Yank it. Okay, try it now. <i>- Try it now.</i> - Okay. Um… Uh… [music swells] [Dustin laughing] ""H."" [Dustin] ""Hi""! - Hi! - Hey! Hi. That worked! [Eddie] Yes! Yes! Hi! Okay. Um… [Robin chuckles] Um… [energy thrumming] [all] ""S… T…"" ""U…"" - ""Stu…"" - Stupid? Stupid? ""…C… K."" - ""Stuck."" - Stuck. - [Steve] Yes. - We are. - They're stuck in the Upside Down. - Okay. Uh, you can't get back through Watergate? - What the hell's Watergate? - 'Cause it's in water and it's a gate. - Oh. - That's cute. - Right. - Um, no. It's… [Lucas] That a six? - ""G""? - No, ""G."" - Yeah. - [all] ""U… A… R."" ""Guar""? Guar… [Dustin echoing] <i>Guar… Guar…</i> - [Erica] ""Guard…"" - [Dustin] ""Guarded."" - [Lucas] ""Guarded""? - Okay. Uh, Watergate's guarded. Perfect. Yes. Yes. Yes. We think we have a theory that can help with that. - Yes. - Genius child. We think Watergate isn't the only gate. That there's a gate at every murder site. [Dustin] <i>…murder site.</i> Does anybody understand what he's talking about? - No. - No idea. Okay. Seriously? How many times do I have to be right on the money before you trust me? Jesus Christ. This kid's gotta get his ego in check. It's his tone. Right? - I know. - Okay. So… So how far is your trailer? Seven miles. Nancy? Uh, I know your house here is, like, weirdly, creepily frozen in time and shit, but haven't you always had bikes? [ethereal music stops] [police radio chatter] [Mrs. Wheeler] So, anything? - Nope. She's sticking to her story. - [""Running Up That Hill"" plays] They went to the lake for a night swim. Nancy showed up at some point… - [Powell continues indistinctly] - [mouthing] [mouthing] Come on! [Powell] …same thing she said here on the couch. Pretty much all she told us. She stuck to her guns. Honestly, shouldn't have gone with her first. She was, like, kinda mean. [Powell] We'll find your daughter, Mrs. Wheeler. Don't worry. One of these little brats is gonna squeal. I just know it. Where are they? Upstairs. Moping. Oh little pigs. Oh little pigs. [rapping lightly] Let Officer Callahan in. [mysterious music playing] - [dog barking] - [clattering outside window] - [Lucas] Let's go. - [Max] Careful. [Callahan] Hey! - Excuse me! No, get back here! - [kids whispering] [Dustin] Let's go! Let's go! - I guess it's just a minor misdemeanor. - [Callahan] Hey! No! No! - [Mrs. Wheeler grunts] - [parents panting] - Lucas! - [Mrs. Henderson] Dusty! Dusty! [Mrs. Sinclair] Lucas, Erica! Get back here! [Mrs. Henderson] Dusty! [sinister music playing] [creatures chittering] [shrieking] [music fades away] [chip clattering] [tops whirring] [energy thrumming] [door opens] [Eleven panting] [Brenner] That's your favorite, isn't it? How are you feeling today? [Ten] Okay. [Brenner] Are you up for some more lessons? Good. [sinister music playing] I feel dizzy. Dizzy? Yes. And the light. The light is hurting my head. [toys clattering] [sighs] [foreboding music playing] [medical monitor beeping] [door opens] Sorry to bother you. - Everything all right? - Not sure. She says she's still dizzy. Lights are hurting her. Hurting who? [suspenseful music playing] [steam hissing] [whispers] Quiet. Follow me. [orderly grunts] Now, it's going to be a bit scary in here, but this, this will lead you out beyond the lab fence to the woods. But you're too big. [mysterious music playing] I'm not going with you, Eleven. I meant what I said when I called this place a prison. And everyone here is a prisoner, not just you. Not just your brothers and sisters, but the guards, too, the nurses. Me. [uneasy stinger] Here. Can you feel it? Your papa calls it Soteria. It weakens me. It tracks me. Even if there were another way out, he will find me. And if he finds me, he will find you. What if I make it go away? You helped me. I help you. [hopeful music playing] [Demogorgon bellowing] [pounding on door] [Demogorgon continues bellowing] [in Russian] Stay calm. Stay close. Stick to the plan. [ominous synth music playing] [Joyce whimpering] [alarm blaring] American! I enjoy this part... When they still believe there is hope. [alarm continues wailing] [alarm blares] [gears clanking] Whatever comes out of there... hold your ground. HOLD YOUR GROUND! [Hopper panting] What is the American doing? I don't know. Find out! [tense music playing] [Joyce grunts] [guttural snarling] You move so much as an inch, I'll kill you. What? [lighter clinks] [in English] Oh, come on! [in Russian] What is this? Some kind of sick joke? It's no joke. As I said… [in English] …the Americans are very tricky. [Hopper] Come on. Come on. Come on. Tell me that's not out of fluid. Come on! Come on! If you wanna live, then whatever sick, twisted game this is, you're gonna stop it and you're gonna free our friend. Then I'm afraid you're going to have to kill me. Because your friend is already dead. Come on! Come on! Oh, come on! Come on! [music swells, fades away] [feral snarling] [prisoners yelling] - [prisoner screaming] - [bones crunching] [roaring] WHAT ARE YOU DOING? STAY TOGETHER YOU FOOLS! Order your men to shoot. To kill it! If I give that order, I will be shot tomorrow and die a traitor. You want to kill me, do it! [Murray laughs] [muffled yelling] [in English] Come on! Come on! Come on! Ah! Ah! [yells] Get back! Get back! Get the hell back! Get back! Get back! [prisoner yells] [bones crunching] [in Russian] I'll kill him! I'll KILL HIM! TOSS YOUR GUN! OVER TO ME! [intense industrial synth music playing] You, open all the doors below. You understand? OPEN THE DOORS. You open all the doors, that monster will get loose in this prison and we are all dead. I will pull this trigger! OPEN THE DOORS! [Demogorgon snarling] [metal creaking, groaning] They would need a battering ram to open that door. Let the monster feed. [prisoner grunts, screams] [Demogorgon feeding wetly] [Murray] You think I'm playing? You think I won't do it? OPEN THE DOOR! If I open those doors, I condemn not just myself, but all of my comrades to death. In good conscience, I cannot. I will not. [in English] I gotta hand it to you commies. You're committed. [Murray grunting] [prisoner screaming] [Hopper] Stay back! Back! Back! Get back! Get away! - Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. - [console buzzing] - What are you doing? - No idea. There's a lot of buttons. I can't see. I need my glasses. Gimme a second. Come here. No. Give me. Mine! [Hopper grunts] [snarling] Running out of time here! I'm trying! No, no, no. Joyce, we have no idea what these buttons do. You can't just press away like that. [device powering down] Get back! Back! Get back! [Murray] Joyce, just relax. Come on! - [alarm blares] - [gears whir] American! That did it! That did it! Close it, Joyce. - Close it! - [Joyce gasps] [Demogorgon chittering] [snarling] - [panting] - [Demogorgon snarling] [alarm blaring faintly] For a second, I thought we had your miracle. But out of one prison into another. [alarm blares] [gate opening] [gears whirring] [tender, emotional music playing] [creatures chittering in distance] [ominous music playing] [Eddie] Right here. That's gotta be a Guinness World Record. Most miles traveled interdimensionally. Just inhaled a bunch of that crap. [coughs] It's stuck in my throat. [eldritch thrumming] Goddamn. [Eddie] This is where Chrissy died. Like, right where she died. [fissure writhing wetly] I think there's something in there. What the hell is that? [all yelp] [mysterious music playing] No way. [music swells, fades away] [Dustin laughing] Hi there. - Hi. - Hi. [Dustin laughing] [triumphant music plays] Holy shit, this is trippy. Bada-bada-boom! Remember, you can't hurt me more than they already have. [exhales] [eerie music playing] [eerie audio distortions] - [flesh rips] - [grunts] [Soteria clatters] [tense music plays] [orderly] Huh. [unsettling chord] {\an8}Who knew something so small could cause so much trouble? Thank you. [guard] There they are! - Stop! - [orderly] Run. [guard] Freeze! [dramatic music playing] [guard] Stop! [guard] Lock it down! Lock it down! Hey! Where do you think you're going? [electricity sparking] Against the wall. Both of you. Now. No. You don't have to be afraid of them, Eleven. Not anymore. [sinister music playing] Take 'em. [dramatic music playing] [guard yells] [yells, grunts] [bones snapping] Come. Wait here. Don't move. - I'm going to find us a way out. - Wait. How did you... Like I said, we're alike, you and I. [discomforting stinger] [eerie, delicate music playing] [Eleven exhales] [door opens] [door closes] Those stains are, uh… - I dunno what those stains are. - [Robin] Mmm. Not quite sure how these physics work. But, uh… Here goes nothing. [eldritch gurgling] - [ethereal music plays] - There we go. And if my theory is correct… - Huh. Abracadabra. - Holy shit. All right, pull on it! See if it holds! [grunting] [Dustin laughing] This is the craziest shit I've ever seen in my life. And I've seen some crazy shit. Guess I'm the guinea pig. [grunting] Let's clear the landing pad. Oh my God! Oh, thank God. That was fun. All right, guess I'll go. All right. Easy, easy. That <i>was </i>fun. Shit. [Steve chuckles] See you on the other side. On the other side. [Nancy grunting] Nice. [ethereal music continues] [distressing music plays] [yelling] [grunting, groaning] [grunting, panting] Nancy. Hey! Hey! Stay with me. Nancy! Hey! Nancy, wake up. - Wake up! Nancy! - Vecna. [ominous music playing] [jarring stinger] [gasps] [Vecna] <i>Do you remember</i> <i>what you did, Nancy?</i> - [snarls] - [screams] [Vecna] <i>Or have you already forgotten?</i> [Barb panicking] [Vecna] <i>When I kill someone…</i> [Barb's scream echoing] [Vecna] <i>…I never forget.</i> Nancy! [sinister music playing] [sinister music swells] [music trails off] - [alarm wailing] - [gasps] [sinister music plays] [garbled radio static] [garbled radio chatter] [staticky screaming over radio] [screaming continues] [screaming continues] [lights buzzing erratically] [jarring stinger] [distant screaming] [guttural snarl] [Eleven panting] [shrill scream] [sobs] [Eleven sobs] [sinister music continues] [screaming echoes] [music stops abruptly] [panting] [jarring stinger] [straining] [music intensifies] [Two struggling] [eldritch power thrumming] - [bones snap] - [thud] [gasps] [intense music fades away] - [Eleven panting] - [One seething] [One sniffs] [One grunts] I asked you to wait. [Eleven yelling] [Eleven whimpering] Why do you cry for them, Eleven? After everything they did to you? Hmm? You think you need them, but you don't. You don't. Oh, but I know you're just scared. I was scared once too. I know what it's like to be different. To be alone in this world. [thunder booming] [clock ticking] [distant wailing] [clock chimes] [Vecna] <i>I see</i> <i>you've been looking for me, Nancy.</i> <i>You were so close.</i> <i>So close to the truth.</i> <i>How was old, blind, dumb Victor?</i> <i>Did he miss me?</i> <i>I've been meaning to check back in,</i> <i>but I've been busy.</i> [horrifying stinger] <i>So very busy.</i> [sinister organ music playing] - What'd I tell ya? - Wow. This is amazing. It looks like a fairy tale. A dream. - [Virginia] Alice, no running. - It's so big! This is nice. Yeah. - [Victor] Yeah. - [One] <i>Like you,</i> <i>I didn't fit in with the other children.</i> <i>Something was wrong with me.</i> <i>All the teachers and the doctors said I was…</i> ""Broken,"" they said. My parents thought a change of scenery, a fresh start in Hawkins, might just cure me. It was absurd. As if the world would be any different here. [solemn choir singing] [One] <i>But then…</i> <i>To my surprise, our new home provided</i> <i>a discovery.</i> <i>And a new found sense of purpose.</i> <i>I found a nest of black widows living inside a vent.</i> <i>Most people fear spiders.</i> <i>They detest them.</i> <i>And yet,</i> <i>I found them endlessly fascinating.</i> <i>More than that,</i> <i>I found a great comfort in them.</i> [whoosh] <i>A kinship.</i> <i>Like me,</i> they are solitary creatures. And deeply misunderstood. They <i>are gods of our world.</i> <i>The most important of all predators.</i> <i>They immobilize and feed on the weak,</i> <i>bringing balance and order to an unstable ecosystem.</i> But the human world was disrupting this harmony. You see, humans are a unique type of pest, multiplying and poisoning our world, all while enforcing a structure of their own. A deeply unnatural structure. <i>Where others saw order, I saw a straitjacket.</i> [clock ticking] <i>A cruel, oppressive world</i> <i>dictated by made-up rules.</i> <i>Seconds, minutes,</i> hours, days, weeks, months, years, decades. Each life a faded, lesser copy of the one before. Wake up, eat, work, sleep, reproduce, and die. Everyone is just waiting. Waiting for it all to be over. All while performing in a silly, terrible play, day after day. [ticking] <i>I could not do that.</i> <i>I could not close off my mind</i> <i>and join in the madness.</i> I could not pretend. And I realized I didn't have to. [ticks] [distorted chiming] [unsettling audio distortion] [whirring] I could make my own rules. I could restore balance to a broken world. A predator… But for good. [shrill shriek] [panicked chittering] [rabbit struggling] As I practiced, I realized I could do more than I possibly imagined. <i>I could reach into others,</i> <i>into their minds,</i> <i>their memories.</i> [bones cracking] [rabbit shrieking] [bones cracking] I became an explorer. I saw my parents as they truly were. To the world, they presented themselves as good, normal people. But like everything else in this world, it was all a lie. A terrible lie. They had done things, Eleven. Such awful things. [dramatic organ music continues] [baby wailing] <i>I showed them who they really were.</i> [baby wailing] <i>I held up a mirror.</i> <i>My naive father believed</i> <i>it was a demon cursing them for their sins.</i> <i>But my mother somehow knew.</i> <i>Knew it was I who was holding up that mirror,</i> <i>- and she despised me for it.</i> - [""Dream a Little Dream"" playing faintly] <i>- She called a doctor, an expert.</i> - [static garbling signal] <i>She wanted him to lock me away, to fix me,</i> <i>even though it wasn't I who was broken. It was them.</i> <i>And so she left me with no choice.</i> <i>No choice but to act.</i> <i>To break free.</i> [energy thrumming] [dramatic music playing] [Virginia screams] [bones cracking] <i>With each life I took, I grew stronger.</i> <i>More powerful.</i> <i>They were becoming a part of me.</i> <i>But I was still a child.</i> [electricity buzzing] <i>And I did not yet know my limits.</i> <i>And it nearly killed me.</i> <i>He was arrested, blamed for the death of my sister and mother,</i> <i>just as I had planned.</i> But I was far from free. <i>I woke up from my coma only to find myself placed in the care of a doctor,</i> <i>the very doctor I had hoped to escape.</i> <i>Dr. Martin Brenner.</i> [monitor beeping] <i>Papa.</i> But the truth… The truth is he did not just want to study me. He wanted more. He wanted to control. <i>When Papa finally realized he could not control me,</i> <i>he tried to recreate me.</i> [tattoo needle buzzing] <i>He began a program.</i> <i>And soon,</i> <i>others were born.</i> You were born. And I am so glad you were, Eleven. So very glad. They're not gone, Eleven. They're still with me. [mysterious music playing] In here. You tricked me. Tricked you? No, I saved you. You are a prisoner here, just like me. To your papa, you are nothing more than an animal, a monster, a lab rat to be tamed. But the truth, Eleven, the truth is just the opposite. You are better than they are. [emotional aria playing] Superior. That is why you frighten him. If you come with me, for the first time in your life, you will be free. Imagine what we could do together. We could reshape the world, remake it however we see fit. Join me. [aria swells] No. [music stops abruptly] - [Eleven grunts] - [One grunts] [One pants] [intense music playing] [lights buzzing] [Eleven struggling] [One growling] [slippers squeaking] [high-pitched ringing] [grunts] He had found his strength in a memory from his past. <i>Something that made him sad.</i> [powerful music building] <i>But also angry.</i> [bullies grunting] Do you have a memory like that? No! No! Jane! [Eleven yelps] [thud] [whimpering] [sinister snarling] [Eleven screams] No! No! [energy thrumming] [Eleven screams] It wasn't supposed to end like this.

A tribe of villagers are under threat from an evil force from the swamps of Kuzatan. Will, it's so early. Is it? Is it early, Michael? Tell that to the villagers crying for your help, the children so frightened, they cannot sleep. Are you truly going to let them perish?

[GROANS] [GRUNTS] [SLURPS, BURPS] [GRUNTS] [KNOCKING] [JOYCE] Hopper? Are you there? Oh! Look who it is! We need to talk. Yeah, we do. I haven't been stood up like that since Alice Gilbert in the 9th grade. What are you doing? Joyce. - Hello? - Just watch. Okay, you're freaking me out. - You slipped on this, remember? - Yeah. Yeah, it fell in the night. It lost its magnetism. - Oh, did it? - And the same exact thing happened at my house the day before. - Wow. - And I thought, ""Okay, that's weird."" Right? Why are all these magnets suddenly losing their magnetism? - Uh-huh? - So, I went and saw Scott. Scott. Who's Scott? - Scott Clarke. - Your child's science teacher? He's pretty brilliant, actually. And I asked him, ""How is this happening?"" And he built this magnetic field using an AC transformer and plugging it into a solenoid. And... And with that solenoid, which basically... Slow down, slow down. I just want to get this exactly right, okay? You stand me up... - [SIGHS] - ... no phone call, no apology, because you had to go to Scott Clarke's house. Yeah. [SCOFFS] [CHUCKLES] You've outdone yourself, Joyce. You really have. No, you've outdone yourself. Oh, come on, Hop, you're not even listening to me. Scott was able to demagnetize some of the magnets, and he thinks... I don't care what Scott thinks! He thinks that a large-scale magnetic field could be built using some sort of machine or... or experimental technology. He's brilliant, isn't he? He's really brilliant. Is he single too? [SCOFFS] What if it's them? To build a machine like this, you need resources. You need scientists, you need funding, - tens of millions of dollars. - Joyce. It can't just be a coincidence, Hopper. It has to be them. Joyce, stop. It has to be the lab. It is impossible. - Well, then, prove it to me. - Prove it? - Yeah, take me back there. - To the lab. Yeah, I wanna go back. Because some magnets fell off your fridge. Yes. Okay, makes sense. [SCOFFS] Thank you. It makes sense. I'm sorry. I'm a little busy right now, but maybe we can meet up there, like tonight, like seven o'clock? You know, of course, unless something comes up - which, you know, it will. - You know, after everything that's happened, this is no joke. [HOPPER] No, I don't think it's a joke. I think that when I asked you out, I think you got scared. I think you got scared, and now, you're inventing things. You're inventing things to get worked up about so that you can push me away. Because God forbid any of us move on! Because that... that would be... [CHUCKLES] I mean, that would be too much, right, Joyce? You know? That would be too much, wouldn't it, Joyce? Wouldn't it, Joyce? [DISTANT CROW SQUAWKS] Joyce? Joyce! - What the hell are you doing? - I need to borrow these. No, you're not going back there. Joyce... - Joyce, you're not going back there... - [CAR DOOR OPENS] Son of a bitch! [THUNDER RUMBLING] [MAX] It's gonna start pouring soon. We should be at the mall or, like, watching a movie or something. You don't believe me? I believe you saw some super weird stuff, totally, but you said Mike has sensed you in there before, right? So maybe it was just like that. Maybe Billy just... sensed you somehow. - But the screams. - Yeah, I know, but here's the thing. When Billy is alone with a girl, they make, like, really crazy noises. - They scream? - Yeah, but, like... happy screams. - Happy screams? What is happy screams? - It's like... I'm just gonna lend you my mom's Cosmo. [MAX] His car's not here. You really want to do this? Why do I get the feeling we're gonna find all kinds of wrong in here? [HEAVY METAL PLAYING ON STEREO] [MAX] Ugh! Gag me with a spoon. [DOOR CREAKING] Max? [MAX] Ice. It's just ice. Probably for his muscles or something. He works out like a maniac.

I mean, listen, I thought she was crazy too, but... - She told me Johnson killed Kennedy. - [MEN LAUGH] But, it turns out, she's not alone. Blackburn's Supply, Hawkins Farming, the Crawleys, they've all had some supplies go missing, all in the past few days. And it's not just fertilizer. It's pesticides, cleaning supplies, diesel fuel. And that's just from one day of calling around. I mean... there's gotta be more. Okay, wait, wait, wait. Let me get this little... story of yours straight. So, little rodents have gone cuckoo in their furry little minds and they're running around the town of Hawkins, dining out on chemicals. I know how it sounds, but... But you've got proof! [MEN LAUGH] I mean, fellas, you gotta admit, it's a hell of a headline, right? ""Hawkins Rodents Prefer Poison: Nutjob Tells All."" - [TOM] Guys, that's enough. - [LAUGHTER STOPS] I think this is... big. Bigger than one article. In fact, I think this has got to be a book. The Mysterious Case of the Missing Fertilizer, a Nancy Drew mystery. [MEN LAUGH] Next time a call comes in, do what you were hired for, and let us know, yeah? Ah... We'll decide what's a story and what's not. Okay. - [MEN LAUGH] - Bye-bye, Nancy Drew. Hey, it's okay. Nancy. Nancy! [BELL DINGING] - [MAN SPEAKING RUSSIAN ON HEADPHONES] - Excuse me. Ahoy!

Right, okay, duffel bags. - Oh, you've gotta be kidding me. - What? [STEVE] Anna Jacobi's talking with that meathead Mark Lewinsky. If you're not gonna focus, just gimme the binoculars. Aw, Jesus Christ, whatever happened to standards? [STEVE] I mean, Lewinsky never even came off the bench. Dude, you are the worst spy in history, you know that? - Stop, hey. Stop. - Give me those. I don't get why you're looking at girls. You have the perfect one in front of you. - Seriously, if you say Robin again... - Robin. - No, don't. No. - Robin, Robin, Robin. - Stop, no, no, no. - Robin. Robin. - Robin. - No. - Robin. - No! No, man, she's not my type. She's not even... in the ballpark of what my type is, all right? What's your type again? Not awesome? - Thank you. - Hm. For your information, she's still in school. And she's weird. She's a weirdo. And she's hyper. I don't like that she's hyper. And she did drama. That's a bad look. And she's in band? - No. - Now that you're out of high school, which means you're technically an adult, don't you think it's time you move on from primitive constructs such as popularity? Oh, primitive constructs? That some stupid shit you learned at Camp... Know... Nothing? Camp Know Where, actually. - And no, it's shit I learned from life. - Hm. Instead of dating somebody you think's gonna make you cooler, why not date somebody you actually enjoy being around? Like me and Suzie. Oh, Suzie. Yeah, you mean, ""hotter than Phoebe Cates."" Yeah, that Suzie. And, uh, let's think about how exactly did you score that beautiful girlfriend? Oh, yeah. With my advice. Because that's how this works, Henderson. I give you the advice, you follow through. Not the other way around, all right, pea-brain? [THUNDER RUMBLING] [WILL] Do you guys hear that? It sounds like... thunder.

You miss. Your flail clanks the stone, the zombie horde lumbers towards you, and... the juju bites your arm. Flesh tears! Aah! Seven points of damage. [SARCASTICALLY] Oh, no, my arm. - Lucas, look, my arm. - [SNICKERS] Sir Lucas, the zombie horde roars! Do you fight back or do you run? [PHONE RINGING] No! It's a distraction! A trap. Do not answer it. What... No! El? [MIKE] No. Sorry, not interested. Telemarketers. Maybe we should just call them. We can do that? - I think so. - Yeah, but what would we say? We'll say nothing! The Khuisar tribe still needs your help. All right, then. I'll use my torch to set fire to the chambers, sacrificing ourselves, killing the jujus, and saving the Khuisar. We all live on as heroes in the memories of the Kalamar. Victory. Okay. Fine. - You guys win. - [MUSIC STOPS] - Congratulations. - Will, I was just messing around. Hey, let's finish for real. - How much longer is the campaign? - Just forget it, Mike. No, you want to keep playing, right? Y-Yeah, totally. We'll just call the girls afterwards. I said forget it, Mike, okay? - I'm going home. - But... - Come on, Will. - Move! [SIGHS] [MIKE] Will, come on. You can't leave. It's raining. Listen, I said I was sorry, all right? It's a cool campaign. It's really cool. We're just not in the mood right now. Yeah, Mike. That's the problem. You guys are never in the mood anymore. - You're ruining our party. - That's not true.

So you can swap spit with some stupid girl? El's not stupid. It's not my fault you don't like girls. [THUNDER RUMBLING] I'm not trying to be a jerk. Okay? But we're not kids anymore.

We can take it to an animal control center, they can run some blood tests on it, - figure out what's wrong with it... - Whoa, Nancy, slow down. Tom didn't ask for proof.

We just wanted to make sure everything was okay. Okay? - Why wouldn't it be okay? - Where is she? I'm sorry. Where is who? Well, they're a little burnt, I'm sorry... Heather! This is my sister, Maxine. And, I'm sorry, I did not quite catch your name. El. [THUNDER RUMBLING] El. Now, what is it you were saying, El? You were looking for somebody? [ELEVEN MURMURS] I... I saw... - I saw you... - Your manager. At the pool. He said you guys didn't come in to work today, so we got worried. Heather wasn't feeling so hot today, so we thought we'd take the day off to nurse her back to health. But you're feeling just fine right now, aren't you, Heather? I'm feeling so much better.

It's an emergency! - [moans] [moans] Who's your buddy? Who's your buddy? Love you, Mom. Lucas, you copy? I've got four quarters. What's your haul? Take your puny haul and multiply it by five. - How? - While you were scrounging around like a homeless bum, I mowed Old Man Humphrey's lawn. Old Man Humphrey's got that kinda cash? - Just call Mike already. - You call Mike. I have to go take a shower from doing real work, like a man. Over and out. [Dustin over walkie-talkie] Mike, do you copy? Mike, do you copy? Yeah. Yeah, I copy. - What are you doing on this channel? - Nothing. Lucas and I have six bucks total. - What's your haul? - Shit! I don't know yet. - What do you mean you don't know yet? - Hold on. Call Will. What the hell are you doing? I'll pay you back! - [Mike] Bye! - [Nancy] Mike! - Mike! Get back here! - Hey. No running in the house. What is going on? [Nancy] Mike! Mike! Asshole! - Hey! - Okay. So, I'll pick you up in two hours. - That's 9:00 on the dot, okay? - Okay. If anything happens, if you need to come home, just ask them to use their phone and call home. Okay? - Don't... - Don't walk or bike home. I know. - Okay, but, sweetie... - Mom, I have to go. Have fun. To slay the dragon, use the magic sword. [Dustin] Oh, Jesus! I'm in unchartered territory here, guys. - Down! Down! Down! - [Dustin] I'm going! I'm going! [exclaims] I'm going! I'm going! I'm going! - [all clamoring] - Okay. Shut up. Shut up. Shut up! No. No. No! No! No! No! I hate this overpriced bullshit! Son of a bitch! Piece of shit! You're not nimble enough. But you'll get there one day. But until then, Princess Daphne is still mine. Whatever. I'm still tops on Centipede and Dig Dug. [Keith] You sure about that? Sure about what? You're kidding me. No, no, no. Move! Move! No, no, no, no, no. Hey, no! No! No! [video game chimes] - 751,300 points! - [Mike] That's impossible. - Who is Mad Max? - Better than you. - Is it you? - [scoffs] You know I despise Dig Dug. - Then who is it? - Yeah, spill it, Keith. You want information, then I need something in return. No, no, no. No way. You're not getting a date with her. Mike, come on. Just get him the date. I'm not prostituting my sister! - But it's for a good cause. - No, don't get him the date. Know what? He's gonna spread his nasty-ass rash to your whole family. Acne isn't a rash and it isn't contagious, you prepubescent wastoid. Oh, I'm a wastoid? She wouldn't go on a date with you. You make, like, what? $2.50 an hour? - [Keith] Nice perm. - Gonna make fun of my hair? [rumbling] Hey. Hey, guys, do you see the... - [crashing] - [gasps] - [thunder crashing] - [electricity crackling] - Will! Are you okay? - [gasps] Yeah. I just... - I needed some air. - Come on. You're up on Dig Dug. Let's take that top score back, huh? [Murray] Good morning, Jim. - Jim. Hold on a second. We need to talk. - Get away from me. Okay, no... I think you really wanna hear this. - Get away from me. - Trust me. I only want five minutes! Yeah, I want a date with Bo Derek. We all want things. This isn't a laughing matter, Jim. - This is serious, okay? - [groans] I really got something here. I'm telling you! - Hey. Mornin', Chief. - Morning. Morning, Murray. Got any proof on your butt-probin' aliens yet, Murray? - [Powell laughs] - I believe there was, and may still be, a Russian spy presence in Hawkins. Russian spies! Are the spies in cahoots with the aliens? Or how do they fit in here? I'm confused. I'm talking multiple reports now. Multiple reports, okay? Of a Russian child in Hawkins. - A child? What are you talking about? - A girl who may have psionic abilities. - ""Psionic""? - Psychic. What about that girl that made that kid pee himself? - A prank. - What girl? - Wasn't a prank. - [Hopper mocks] You got five minutes. Not a second more. [Murray] I talked to a Big Buy ex-employee who said some little girl shattered the door with her mind. I heard that story. Did you hear the one about the fat man with the beard who climbs down chimneys? [Murray] Then last month, a co-worker of Ted Wheeler's claims some Russian girl with a shaved head was hiding in his basement. Ted now denies this. - Oh, wow. That's a surprise. - But it connects. - Enlighten me. - This girl, she's some kind of a Russian weapon, right? Barbara sees this girl, tries to help her, perhaps. But before she can, the Russians find them, take them... Wait. You're telling me Barbara Holland was kidnapped by Russian spies. - Kidnapped. Killed. - Killed? - Don't you get it, Jim? - No. This has potentially international implications. I'm talking a full-on Russian invasion right here in Hawkins. [whirring] Do you have any proof of this girl? I mean, has anybody seen her recently? - These are separate... - [phone rings] Excuse me. Sorry. - Okay. - Hello? Merrill called, wants you to check out his pumpkins. - Says they've been contaminated... - All right. ...by his vengeful neighbor, Eugene. You're welcome. I'm sorry. I really hate to do this, but I gotta run. - It's an emergency. - You gave me five minutes. Yeah, listen, you know what? I liked your alien theory a lot better. And you want my advice? Why don't you stop bleeding those people dry and go home? All right? - I am not bleeding anyone... dry. - Listen to me. Go home. It's crap, I know. No, it's not crap. - It's not good. - It's going to be. - Just... It needs some reorganizing. - [sighs] - Can I mark on it? - Yeah, I guess. So, in the first paragraph, you used the basketball game versus Northern as a metaphor for your life, which is great. But then, around here, you start talking about your granddad's experiences in the war. And I... [stammers] I don't see how they're connected. It connects because... because, you know, we both won. - Do you think I should start from scratch? - No. I mean... When's the deadline? It's tomorrow for early application. Can you come and help me tonight? We have our dinner tonight, remember? - Oh, my God! - We already canceled last week. - You don't have to go. Just work on this. - No, no, no. What's the point? - Hey, calm down. - I'm calm. I'm calm. I'm just being honest. You know, I mean... - I'll end up working for my dad anyway. - That's not true. I don't know, Nance. Is that such a bad thing? There's insurance and benefits and all that adult stuff. And if I took it, you know, I could be around for your senior year. - Steve... - Just to look after you a little bit. Make sure you don't forget about this pretty face. [chuckles] Nance, I'm serious. - I love you. - I love you, too. [car engine revving] [tires screeching] Who is that? I have no idea. But would you check out that ass? Just look at it go. [giggles] [bell ringing] Meet the human brain. I know. I know, it doesn't look like much. A little gross even, right? But consider this. There are a hundred billion cells inside of this miracle of evolution. All working as one. No, no, I did not misspeak. I did not stutter. A hundred billion. - [door closes] - Ah, this must be our new student. [principal] Indeed. All yours. All right. Hold up. You don't get away that easy. Come on up. Don't be shy. Dustin, drum roll. Class, please welcome, all the way from sunny California, the latest passenger to join us on our curiosity voyage, Maxine. - It's Max. - [Mr. Clarke] Sorry? Nobody calls me Maxine. It's Max. - [whispers] Mad Max. - Well, all aboard, Max. - Hey, there. - Hey. Do you have these in any other colors? I'm not a big fan of orange. Hmm... I'll have to check in back. Oh, shit! - You're gonna get me fired. - That's my master plan. Get you fired so I can hire you and we won't have to hide back here. Bob? Bob, I have to get back to work. I know. I'm sorry. I can't stop thinking about you. - It's crazy. I feel like a teenager. - Me, too. You know, in high school, you didn't know who I was. Come on. [chuckles] Bob, I have to get back to work. Okay. Go sell your electronic thingamajiggies, and I'll see you tonight for movie night. Jonathan's night to pick? - Yes. - Okay. - Okay. Okay. - Okay. Hey, look, a green one. Tell Jonathan not to pick anything scary. I hate scary movies. [Hopper] You're saying this was fine yesterday? [Merrill] Fine? These were prize winners, Chief. You should've seen 'em. For the life of me, I couldn't figure out what happened. And then I remembered... Eugene. What about him? He's been complaining about me to just about anyone who'll listen. Why's that? Well, he started this ""Pick Your Pumpkin"" thing. Acted like it was trademarked. I said, ""Hire yourself a damn lawyer. See how far that gets you."" You're telling me that nice old Eugene came out here after dark and doused your field with poison? Not Eugene himself. - I'm thinking one of his field hands. - Uh-huh. Listen, Chief, I don't go throwing around accusations lightly. You know me. This happening the day before Halloween, when sales are peaking? That's a hell of a coincidence. - Hell of a coincidence. - [flies buzzing] You got somebody working on that field? [rustling] [rustling continues] - [screeching] - [yells] - [panting] - [caws] Yeah, screw you, too. [Tina] Hey. Be there. - Hey, Nancy. - Hey! Thanks. - Oh, could I get one more? - Yeah, sure. You're coming to this. ""Come and get sheet faced."" No, I'm not. I can't let you sit all alone Halloween. That's just not acceptable. Well, you can relax. I'm not gonna be alone. I'm going trick-or-treating with Will. - All night? - Yeah. No, no way. You're gonna be home by 8:00, listening to the Talking Heads and reading Vonnegut or something. Sounds like a nice night. Jonathan, just come. I mean, who knows, you might even, like, meet someone. - [shrieks] - [chuckles] - Oh, my God! Take those stupid things off. - I missed you. - It's been like an hour. - Tell me about it. Okay. Okay, okay. God. [Steve] Sorry. - [Mike] There's no way that's Mad Max. - Yeah. Girls don't play video games. And even if they did, you can't get 750,000 points on Dig Dug. - It's impossible. - [Lucas] But her name is Max. - So what? - So, how many Maxes do you know? - I don't know. - [Lucas] Zero. That's how many. She shows up at school the day after someone with her same name breaks our top score. - I mean, you kidding me? - Exactly. So she's gotta be Mad Max. And plus she skateboards, so she's pretty awesome. Awesome? You haven't even spoken a word to her. I don't have to. I mean, look at her. Shit, I've lost the target. Oh! There. Got it. There we go. [all] ""Stop spying on me, creeps."" Well, shit. [principal] William Byers. Your mother's here. [Dustin] You guys think he's okay? [Lucas] He's always weird when he has to go in. I don't know. He's quiet today. He's always quiet. You feeling any better? Will? Huh? [mumbles] Yeah. Yeah, sorry. Hey. What did we talk about, huh? You've got to stop it with the sorries. Sorry. I mean, yeah, I know. And listen, you know, there's nothing to be nervous about, you know. Just tell 'em what you felt last night and what you saw. Hey, I'm gonna be there the whole time. So it's gonna be okay. Okay? Okay. - Hey, buddy. - Hey. Hey. [clatters] [whirring] Sir Will, how are you? Mom. Pop. Let's take a look, see what's going on here. I see you shaved off a pound since we saw you last. Must be making room for all that Halloween candy. What's your favorite candy? Desert island candy, if you had to pick one? - I don't know. - Come on. Life or death situation, what would you pick? - I guess... Reese's Pieces. - [mouthing] Reese's Pieces. Good call. Good call. I'm more of a Mounds guy, but I gotta say, peanut butter and chocolate, come on, hard to beat that. All right, tell me what's going on with you. Tell me about this episode you had. [Will] Well, my friends were there and then they just weren't, and I was back there again. In the Upside Down? All right, so what happened next? I heard this noise, and so I went outside, and it was worse. How was it worse? There was this storm. [thunder crashing] Okay. So how did you feel when you saw the storm? I felt... frozen. - Heart racing? - Just frozen. Frozen, cold frozen? Frozen to the touch? No. Like how you feel when you're scared, and you can't breathe or talk or do anything. I felt... felt this evil, like it was looking at me. It was evil? Well... [clears throat] What do you think the evil wanted? To kill. [whirring rapidly] To kill you? Not me. Everyone else. [Owens] All right, I'm gonna be honest with you. It's probably gonna get worse before it gets better. Worse? He's already had two episodes this month. He'll likely have more before the month is out. It's called the Anniversary Effect. And we've seen this with soldiers. The anniversary of an event brings back traumatic memories. Sort of opens up the neurological floodgates, so to speak. So what does this mean for the kid? He's gonna have more episodes, nightmares? Yeah, that. Maybe some personality changes. He might get irritable. He might lash out. What do we do when that happens? Okay. Well, from what we know about post-traumatic stress... And we're still learning, okay? Just treat him normally. Be patient with him. Don't pressure him to talk. Just let him lead the way. I'm sorry, what you're saying is it's gonna get worse and worse and we're just supposed to pretend it's not happening? It sounds counterintuitive, I know. But I assure you that is really the best thing you can do for him. Listen. I understand what you went through last year. I get it. But those people are gone. They're gone. Okay? So if we're gonna get through this, I just... I need you to realize I'm on your side. I need you to trust me. [Joyce] ""Trust me""? - Are you kidding me? - [Hopper] Yeah, I know. But, you know, university gives out a degree, this guy's got it. And look, that post-traumatic stuff he's talking about, that stuff is real. He's gonna be okay. All right? How's Bob the Brain? Don't call him that. Sorry. Old habit. He's good. We're good. Good. I'm happy for you. Really. Hey... Things get worse, you call me first. You call me. Okay. They're ready for you, sir. - Patty. - Sam. Afternoon, sir. - Looks like another hot one today, huh? - Never gets old, sir. [screeching] [Dustin] Still no sign? [Lucas] Jack shit. - Oh! Damn it. My mom's gonna murder me. - So go home. I'll radio if she comes. Oh, yeah, nice try. You just want me out of here so you can make your move. - Oh, 'cause you're such a threat. - That's right. She will not be able to resist these pearls. [purrs] - Ten o'clock. Ten o'clock. - What? [indistinct arguing] - They're arguing. They're arguing. - Oh, my God. I see that. I don't even know why you need those. God. You're so stupid. [video game chiming] She's incredible. She's... [both] Mad Max. After dinner, I want you to pick out your toys for the yard sale. - Fine. - Two boxes' worth. - Two boxes? - You heard me. I'm fine with you giving away a couple, but the other ones have way too much emotional value. - Emotional value? - They're hunks of plastic, Michael. You already took away my Atari. Didn't wanna lose more toys, you shouldn't have stolen from Nancy. I didn't steal. I borrowed. Oh, and you didn't curse out Mr. Kowalski last week either, right? Or plagiarize that essay? Or graffiti the bathroom stall? Everyone graffitis the bathroom stall. So if your friend jumps off a cliff, you're gonna jump, too? We know you've had a hard year, Michael. But we've been patient. This isn't strike one. This isn't even strike three. It's strike 20. You're on the bench, son. And if it'd been my coach, you'd be lucky to still be on the team. Two boxes. Two. [Steve] Okay. Ready? Yeah. [sighs] Okay. [doorbell rings] [Marsha] I'm so sorry I didn't get to cook. I was gonna make that baked ziti you guys like so much, but I just forgot about the time, and before you know it, ""Oh, my God, it's five o'clock."" - It's fine. It's great. - Right. I love KFC. So, I noticed a ""For Sale"" sign out in your yard. Is that the neighbors', or... - You wanna tell them? - Go ahead. We hired a man named Murray Bauman. Have either of you heard of him? - No. - No, I don't think so. He was an investigative journalist for the Chicago Sun-Times. He's pretty well known. Anyway, he's freelance now, and he agreed to take the case. That's... That's great. No, that's really... That's great, right? Um, what exactly does that mean? Means he's gonna do what that lazy son of a bitch Jim Hop... Sorry. [exhales] What the Hawkins police haven't been capable of doing. Means we have a real detective on the case. It means... we're going to find our Barb. If anyone can find her, it's this man. He already has leads. By God, he's worth every last penny. Is that why you're selling the house? Don't worry about us, sweetie. We're fine. More than fine. For the first time in a long time, we're hopeful. [stammers] Excuse me. I'll be right back. - It's finger-lickin' good. - Mmm. [breathing heavily] [crying] [toy screeches] El, are you there? El? [static crackling] It's me. It's Mike. It's day 352, 7:40 p.m. I'm still here. If you're out there, say something. Or give me a sign. I won't even say anything. Just... I wanna know if you're okay. [static crackling] I'm so stupid. [distorted voice] Mike. - [Dustin over walkie-talkie] Mike? - Hello, is that you? Yeah, it's me, Dustin. What're you doing on this channel again? I've been trying to reach you all day. We were right. Max is Mad Max. - Yeah, I'm busy. - But... - [Lucas] What do we do now? - We stick to the plan. Mike's not gonna like it. Last time I checked, our party is not a dictatorship. - It's a democracy. - What if Max says no? How can Max say no to these? [purrs] I told you to stop that. - I'll see you tomorrow. - Later. [chirping] Mews! Mews. [crashing] - Stop. Stop! - [Bob] What? Come on, you gotta get used to it. This is the future. Well, put the future down and get me a clean bowl. [knocking on door] Hey, bud. I didn't know what you'd like, so I got a variety. - Take your pick. - Whatever you want. All right. What are you working on? Zombie Boy? Who's Zombie Boy? - Me. - Did someone call you that? Hey. You can talk to me. You know that, right? Whatever happened. Will, come on, talk to me. - Stop treating me like that. - What? Like what? Like everyone else. Like there's something wrong with me. What are you talking about? Mom, Dustin, Lucas. Everyone. They all treat me like I'm gonna break. Like I'm a baby. Like I can't handle things on my own. It doesn't help. It just makes me feel like more of a freak. - You're not a freak. - Yeah, I am. I am. You know what? You're right. You are a freak. - What? - No, I'm serious. You're a freak. But what? Do you wanna be normal? Do you wanna be just like everyone else? Being a freak is the best. I'm a freak. Is that why you don't have any friends? [chuckles] I have friends, Will. Then why are you always hanging out with me? Because you're my best friend, all right? And I would rather be best friends with Zombie Boy than with a boring nobody. You know what I mean? Okay, look... Who would you rather be friends with? Bowie or Kenny Rogers? Ugh. Exactly. It's no contest. The thing is, nobody normal ever accomplished anything meaningful in this world. - You got it? - Well... - some people like Kenny Rogers. - Kenny Rogers. I love Kenny Rogers. [chuckles] - What's so funny? - Nothing. Mr. Mom. [whoops] Perfect! [both chuckle] Where's Mommy keep the extra diapers? [Bob and Joyce laugh] [Jack] Hey! Cowards. [both laugh] [phone ringing] Hey. - It's okay. Let it go. - [phone continues ringing] Probably just a crank call. - Okay. - [Jack] Holy mackerel! - Let it go. - [Jack] Aw, man!

Eddie the freak with Chrissy the cheerleader? Exactly. You know, his name's not in the news yet or anything, but I guarantee you Eddie is suspect one now. That's crazy. Eddie didn't do this. No way. No way. - We can't rule it out. - Yes, we can. - Dustin! - You don't know him like I do, Max. Okay? When we got to high school, Lucas made all his sports friends. Mike and me? I mean, no one was nice to us. No one except Eddie. Okay. Well, they said the same shit about Ted Bundy. Yeah, he's a super nice guy, but then he's murdering women on the weekend. So you're saying Eddie is like Ted Bundy? No, I'm not saying... I'm saying that we can't presume anything, okay? But it doesn't look good for Eddie. [Dustin sighs] [sighs] Why haven't you told the cops this? I… I don't know. You don't know? After I saw Eddie and Chrissy go in the trailer… [eerie music playing] …something else happened.

Maybe he was scared because, you know, he… he just killed someone, or… Maybe, um… Maybe be... because… I don't… I don't know, maybe… Something else killed her. But that's impossible. Right? I don't know. It should be. Only one person knows what actually happened. - Eddie. - [unsettling music whooshes] - Have you talked to anyone else? - No. I can't find Lucas or Nancy, and Mike's in...

Like, I… I can't leave my mom and my brother to… to… to chase a dream that isn't mine. You're dead, man. You are so dead. What was I supposed to do? - Not lie. - Not lie? - Yeah. - Not lie? - Yeah! - What, so I just tell her the truth? - Yes. - No. No. Because… Because if I told her the truth, then she'd just throw her dreams out the window to come out here and be with me. And I… I just can't take that. Like, you know? Like, this… this huge knot of resentment would build, like… like some cancer, until eventually she hates me. And then, before you know it, we're just like my mom and dad. - We're divorced, my kids hate me. - Shit! Yeah, shit! I mean, it's all shit. [groans] The cycle never ends. Yeah, man. Your nightmare cycle. You want it to stop, but what is your approach here? To just slow-motion break up with Nancy? - I guess. - No, man! I know. I don't know what to do. Palm Tree Delight!

Probably sacrificed her, drained her blood for the devil. - Satanists do that. - That's what I'm saying. It's this cult. Hellfire isn't a cult. It's… It's just a D&D club. D… D&D? Dungeons & Dragons? It's like a… It's like a game. It… It's fantasy. And how exactly is it you know all of that, Sinclair? [Lucas] Uh… Well, it's my sister. Yeah, she's like… She's like, a total nerd. - You know? - Yeah. Nerds? Like, she plays a lot sometimes... I'm sure your sister isn't killing people, right? But I've read the wrong person plays this game, it can warp their mind. They confuse fantasy and reality, and innocent people die. Been happening all over the country. It's an epidemic. I've read about that shit. It's real. And I think Eddie… He's the wrong type of person, right? You know, he got lost. He thought Chrissy was just a part of his… his sick game. And chances are, he's still in the game. Meaning... He's gonna kill again. [""Psycho Killer"" by Talking Heads playing] But not if we can help it. Would Chrissy want us to just stand by while the cops go around pursuing some bullshit leads, spreading rumors saying she's some druggy? - No! - No, she'd want us to go out there. - To do something about it, wouldn't she? - Yeah! - Then let's hunt some freak! - Yeah! - For Chrissy! - Yeah! - Let's go! - Yeah! <i>♪ I can't seem to face up to the facts ♪</i> <i>♪ I'm tense and nervous And I can't relax… ♪</i> Let's go! <i>♪ I can't sleep 'cause my bed's on fire ♪</i> <i>♪ Don't touch me, I'm a real live wire… ♪</i> Have you seen or heard from Eddie recently? [Max] Eddie Munson. - When's the last time you talked to him? - [Max] Seen him? - [sighs] Okay. Sorry to bother you. - Know anyone who'd know where he is? I really don't think he's at the arcade. Yep, I'm pretty sure. Reefer Rick? No. Does this Reefer Rick have a last name? I mean, it's kind of… [Steve] All right, <i>Doctor Zhivago.</i> It's a double VHS. It's long. But that's because it's filled with action and romance, and a little bit of suspense. So, my boyfriend won't, like, totally puke when I bring it home? Oh, you… your boyfriend? Uh, no. No. He's gonna… He's gonna love it. Yeah. - See ya. - Yeah, see ya later. Alligator. Goddammit. Hey, guys, I might have a lead. - Seriously? - Yeah. Apparently, Eddie gets drugs from some guy named Reefer Rick, and sometimes Eddie crashes there. Sounds promising. Where does Reefer Rick live? See, that's the thing. No one knows. He's more of a… a legend than someone that people actually know. - Last name? - I don't know that either. [Steve] Bet the cops know the last name. - [Max] What? - Cops. I mean, listen, if this Reefer Rick is actually a drug dealer, I guarantee you he's been busted at some point. - Means he's in the system. - The cops? Really, Steve? That's your suggestion? I think they should be filled in on what we know, what's going on. - You think Eddie's guilty, don't you? - Whoa. I believe in innocent until proven guilty, all that constitutional shit. I just, you know, don't think we can rule it out. That's precisely what we're trying to do here, Steve. And maybe we'd have a little bit more luck if you spent less time trying to find a girlfriend and more time trying to find Eddie. - Somebody has to attend to the customers. - Especially if they're babes, right? Hey, not fair. Okay? I attend to all customers equally, babes and non-babes alike. We've got a very big selection in here. It can be super overwhelming for people. Yeah, it can be. [determined music playing] - What are you doing? - Maybe we don't need a last name. [keyboard clacking] [computer beeping] - Twelve Ricks have accounts here. - [Max] Lot of Ricks. So, let's narrow it down. Rick Alderman's latest rentals are <i>Annie </i>and <i>Dumbo.</i> - Chances our drug dealer has a family? - Not likely. [Robin] All right. Rick Conroy. <i>Sixteen Candles, Teen Wolf, Romancing the Stone.</i> [Max, Steve, Dustin] No. Okay. Rick Joiner. <i>Mask, Footloose,</i> and<i> Grease.</i> Nah. [Robin] Rick Kimbrough. <i>The Blue Lagoon </i>and <i>Splash.</i> - [laughter] - Definitely not. - [Steve] No way. - [Robin] Okay. Rick Lipton. <i>Fast Times at Ridgemont High. Cheech & Chong's Next Movie.</i> <i>Cheech & Chong's Nice Dreams.</i> <i>- Cheech & Chong's Up in Smoke.</i> - [chuckles] Bingo. - Lipton? - Spelled like the tea. 2121 Holland Road. - That's out by Lovers Lake. - Middle of nowhere. It's a perfect place to hide. [engine revs] [intense stinger plays] Um, hi, I'm Nancy Wheeler from the<i> Hawkins Tiger...</i> I've talked to enough reporters. Yeah. [dog barking] - [Nancy sighs] - [light synth music playing] Okay, well… What about that one? With the flag? Yeah, I tried them twice. They were actually quite rude. I am not doing that again. I'm telling you, we've talked to everyone. Nope. Not everyone. Hi there. Hi. Did you see something last night, huh? - [dog whining] - Oh, you wanna tell us everything? Nancy, come on. Let's get outta here. But he's just the cutest little witness. Stay here. Hi. Uh, I'm a friend of Max Mayfield's, over there. You're Wayne Munson, aren't you? Eddie's uncle? That's right. I heard you found the body. - The neighbors, they were... - Like to gossip. And I'm not interested in gossiping no more. Certainly not to a reporter. What gave me away? Look, let me level with you, Mr. Munson. The paper that I write for is… small. We don't have the staff to keep up with the big guys. And I'm just… looking for something, anything really, about what happened last night. Why? Far as I can tell, you all have it figured out already. My nephew's a freak. He killed that girl. Ain't that about right? Let me guess. You've been speaking to the <i>Hawkins Post?</i> Chuck Bailey? Yeah, I used to work with him. I mean, that guy doesn't know his ass from his elbow. Let me tell your side of the story. [ominous music playing] [dog barking] [clock chiming] [sinister audio distortion] [clock ticking] [Wayne] <i>My nephew,</i> <i>he may look dangerous,</i> but he didn't do this. It just… ain't in his nature. No matter what anyone says, and they will say things, believe you me. But… This… wasn't Eddie. The man who did this… Who killed that poor girl, he's… Pure evil. ""Man""? You think you know who might've done this? You ever hear the name Victor Creel? [ominous music intensifies] [Wayne] <i>I guess you're too young,</i> <i>but back when I was a kid,</i> <i>everybody knew the name Victor Creel.</i> He lost his mind. Killed his whole family. Kids and wife. Took their eyes. Cut 'em right out. God. [clock continues chiming] [Wayne] <i>That poor girl</i> <i>I found this morning,</i> <i>same exact thing.</i> <i>So I'm thinking</i> <i>maybe he broke out.</i> Victor Creel is still alive? They locked him away in Pennhurst Asylum. Yeah, as far as I know, he's still there. That is, unless he broke out. <i>Like that… What's his name? White mask and killed the babysitters?</i> [chimes] [Nancy] <i>Michael Myers?</i> - [clock ticking] - [Wayne] <i>Yeah, Michael Myers.</i> - [ticking] <i>- You ask me, Victor's like that.</i> He's a real boogeyman. [wind rushing] [dog barks, whimpers] Um, I'll be right back. [dog continues barking, whimpering] Fred? Fred! Fred! Fred? Fred? [sinister music swells] [chiming, ticking] [muffled weeping] [flesh distending wetly] Murderer. Murderer! - Murderer. Murderer! - Murderer. Murderer. [all chanting] Murderer! Murderer! Murderer! Murderer! Murderer! Murderer! Murderer! Murderer! - Murderer! - [Fred panting] [clippers buzzing] [ominous music playing] [man in Russian] You are no longer men. You are cogs in a machine. A machine in service of our great Motherland. And if you are foolish enough to attempt escape, you will be hunted down. You will be captured. And then you will suffer greatly as you perform your final act for the Motherland. There will be no second chances. [in English] Run, you die. You hear, American? [Enzo on tape] <i>Your friend is… stuck.</i> <i>But you get me money, I make him unstuck.</i> <i>You must trust me.</i> [Joyce on tape] <i>How do I trust...</i> Joyce, whoever Enzo is, the answer is not on that tape. [woman speaking Russian indistinctly on tape] [in English] You don't hear that? In the background? So he's outside. Someone's talking. Not surprising. I think she's talking to Enzo. Play it again. [woman speaking Russian indistinctly on tape] [in English] Can you translate that? Uh, I… I can't understand it. It's too low. [dramatic music playing] [alarm buzzing] [men speaking Russian] [metallic clanging] [in English] Hey! [men chattering in Russian] [Enzo in English] <i>But you get me</i> <i>money, I make him unstuck.</i> - Turn it up. - <i>You must trust me.</i> [Joyce on tape] <i>How do I trust you?</i> <i>I don't know who you are.</i> She… She wants to use the phone. She's mad at Enzo. [speaking Russian] - Calls him a ""moosor."" - ""Moosor""? - It's slang. - For what? [Murray] <i>Literally, ""moosor"" translates</i> <i>to trash or garbage.</i> Like ""pig"" here, often directed at cops. Cops? Or guards. Hopper's stuck. [Hopper grunts] And Enzo can get him unstuck. [Enzo] Yeah. It's not exactly the Ritz, is it? Welcome to your new home, American. Enzo's a prison guard. Maybe Hopper bribed him. Sounds like Jim, doesn't it? [chuckles] - Joyce, where are you going? - Bank. I'm gonna get Enzo his damn money, and we are getting Hopper back. Okay. [suspenseful music builds to climax] El? What the hell? Get out! - Not there? - No. - Should've told me she was having trouble. - I didn't know they were gonna be here. You knew she was having trouble for a year and didn't tell me. - I didn't know she was lying to you. - Which is why you were a douche all day? - I wasn't being a douche. - You were. You were rolling your eyes, moping. You were barely talking. - You basically sabotaged the whole day. - She was lying to you. Straight to your face, ever since you got here. And I've been a total third wheel all day. It's been miserable. So, sorry if I wasn't… wasn't smiling. Yeah, whatever, man. Well, what about us? What? You're mad that I didn't talk to you? You made it super clear that you're not interested in anything I have to say. - That's just not true. - You've called maybe a couple times. It's been a year, Mike. Meanwhile, El has a book of letters from you. - That's because she's my girlfriend, Will. - And us? We're friends. We're friends. We used to be best friends. [emotional synth music playing] Then maybe you should've reached out more. I don't know. But why is this on me? Why… Why am I the bad guy? [sighs] Let's just… Let's just find her. Okay? [sighs] [weeping softly] [Angela, bullies laughing] [bully] Yeah. - [Angela] Oh my God, her face. - [bully 1] Right? - She looks like she shit herself. - Yeah. [bullies chuckling] Angela. - Uh-oh. Look who it is. - [bully 1] She looks upset. You ruined my day. [chuckles] Oh no. Did we embarrass you in front of your boyfriend? I want you to say sorry to me, and I want you to tell my boyfriend that it was just a joke and that we are really friends. Or what? You gonna hurt us with your mean stare again? [Angela giggles] Sorry you can't cry to teacher today. You'll just have to cry to your daddy instead. Oh, wait. Can't do that either. [bully 1 scoffs cruelly] [bullies laughing] [ominous audio distortion] [bystander] Hey! [Angela laughing] Angela. [Angela screams] Holy shit. Angela, you okay? - Angela, hey. You okay? - [bystander 1] Oh my God! - [bystander 2] What did she do? - Oh my God. - Oh my God, what do we do? - Oh, shit. [Angela shrieks] [bully 1] You're okay. You're okay. [Angela sobbing] [ominous music intensifies] [Angela wailing] Oh… Oh my God. Holy shit, El. What did you do? [echoing] What did you do? - What have you done? What have you done? - [eerie audio distortion] - [Angela screams] - [Eleven shudders] [Angela's scream echoes, fades] [doorbell rings] [doorbell rings rapidly] Okay. Well, that's settled. I guess he's not here. - Eddie! It's Dustin! - Great. [tense music playing] Look, we just wanna talk, okay? No cops, I swear. We just wanna help. Eddie! [Robin] Shh. [doorbell ringing continuously] [Dustin] Rick! [Dustin bangs on door] Reefer Rick! [Steve] Don't scream that. - Rick! - He's not there. - Reefer Rick! - Just… He could just be really high. - [Steve] Is that a foot? - [Dustin] No, that's a shoe. Hey, guys? [tense music intensifies] Hello? Is anyone home? What a dump. - [tense musical flourish] - What are you doing? What are you doing? He might be in here. So take the tarp off. If you're so brave, you take the tarp off. [floorboards creaking] Hey, look over here. Someone was here. Maybe he heard us. Got spooked and ran. Don't worry. Steve will get him with his oar. I know you think you're being funny, but considering everyone in this room has nearly died a hundred times, personally, I don't find it funny in the slight... - [tense music intensifies] - Whoa! [Steve] Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait! Whoa, whoa, whoa, Eddie! Eddie! Stop! Eddie! Eddie! It's me. It's Dustin. This is Steve. He's not gonna hurt you, right, Steve? Right. Yeah. Steve, why don't you drop the oar? - [Steve groans] - He's cool. He's cool. I'm cool, man. I'm cool. - What are you doing here? - We're looking for you. We're here to help. [Dustin] Eddie, these are my friends. - You know Robin, from band. - [imitates playing instrument] [Dustin] This is my friend Max. The one who never wants to play D&D. Eddie. We're on your side. I swear on my mother. - Right, guys? - Yes. Yes. We swear. On Dustin's mother. Yeah, Dustin's… Dustin's mother. [suspenseful music builds] [music halts] [grunts] Jesus Ch… Eddie… We just want to talk. Okay? We want to know what happened. [sniffs] You won't believe me. Try us. [Nancy] Fred! Fred! Excuse me. Hi. Excuse me, sorry. Have you seen my friend wandering around? Uh, nerdy, glasses, scar on his face? [man] No, sorry. [ominous music playing] [police radio squawks] Hi, officer? - Officer? - What are you still doing here? My… My friend from the car earlier, I… I can't find him. What do you mean? He was there and then he was just gone and… Did you maybe see him leave with somebody or…? I told you kids to go home. Jesus Christ. This is Glenn. We might have a situation here. [ominous music intensifies] [Fred panting] - [breathes shakily] - [crackling] [Eddie] Her body just, like, lifted up into the air and, uh… And she just, like, hung there. In the air. And her bones… Uh, she… [whimpers] Her bones started to snap. [bones cracking] Her eyes, man. It… It was like there was something, like, inside her head, pulling. - [bones cracking] - [Eddie screaming] I… I didn't know what to do, so I… I ran away. I left her there. [scoffs] You all think I'm crazy, right? No. We don't think you're crazy. Don't bullshit me, man! I know how this sounds. - We're not bullshitting you. - We believe you. [exhales] [Dustin] Look, what I'm about to tell you might be a little… difficult to take. Okay. You know how people say Hawkins is… Cursed? They're not way off. [eerie music playing] [Dustin]<i> There's another world.</i> [echoing screams] [Dustin] <i>A world hidden beneath Hawkins.</i> Sometimes it bleeds into ours. Like ghosts and shit? There are some things worse than ghosts. - [glass shattering] - [gasps] [moaning] Help me! [moaning continues] [yells] [groans, grunts] [disembodied high-pitched shrieking] [panicked gasping] No, no, no… [Dustin] <i>These monsters</i> <i>from this other world…</i> - Help! Somebody! - <i>…we thought they were gone.</i> - Nancy, please! <i>- But they've come back before.</i> That's why we needed to find you. If they're back again, we need to know. [sinister voice] Fred. [guttural growling] [Robin]<i> That night,</i> did you see anything? Dark particles, maybe? [wet squelching] [creature growling] It would almost look like dust, swirling dust. No, man, there was nothing you could see or, uh… Or touch. [snarling] [whimpering] What do you want? I want you to join me. No, no, no, no. [malevolent music playing] [eerie choral music playing] [Eddie] <i>You know,</i> <i>I tried to wake her, man.</i> She couldn't move. It was like she… she was in a trance or something. Or under a spell. A curse. Vecna's curse. [bones cracking] Who's Vecna? An undead creature of great power. A spell caster. A dark wizard.
